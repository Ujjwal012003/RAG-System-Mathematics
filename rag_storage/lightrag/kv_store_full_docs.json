It may be very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of beauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a beautifulpoet \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nRecall that the notion of relations and functions, domain, co-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI along with different types of specific real valued functions and their graphs. The concept of the term‘relation’ in mathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation in English language, according to which two objects or quantities are related if there is a recognisable connection or link between the two objects or quantities. Let A be the set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the set of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some of the examples of relations from A to B are \n\n(i) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B } \\} .$ a is brother of $b \\}$ ， Lejeune Dirichlet   \n(ii) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B } \\colon$ a is sister of $b \\}$ ， (1805-1859)   \n(i) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { A } \\times \\mathrm { B }$ age of $a$ is greater than age of $b \\}$ ，   \n(iv) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { A } \\times \\mathrm { B }$ : total marks obtained by $a$ in the final examination is less than the total marks obtained by $^ { b }$ in the final examination},   \n(v) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B } ; a$ lives in the same locality as $b \\}$ . However, abstracting from this, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset of $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B }$ \n\nIf $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ ,we say that $a$ is related to $^ { b }$ under the relation R and we write as $a$ R $^ { b }$ .In general, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ ，we do not bother whether there is a recognisable connection or link between $a$ and $^ { b }$ .As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of relations. \n\nIn this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations. \n\n1.2 Types of Relations \n\nIn this section, we would like to study different types of relations.We know that a relation in a set A is a subset of $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ .Thus, the empty set $\\phi$ and $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ are two extreme relations.For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A $\\backslash = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\}$ given by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( a , b )$ $a - b = 1 0 \\}$ . This is the empty set, as no pair $( a , b )$ satisfies the condition $a - b = 1 0$ Similarly, $\\mathrm { R } ^ { \\prime } = \\{ ( a , b ) : | a - b | \\geq 0 \\}$ is the whole set $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A } .$ ,as all pairs $( a , b )$ in $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ satisfy $| \\ a - b \\ | \\geq 0$ . These two extreme examples lead us to the following definitions. \n\nDefinition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is related to any element ofA, i.e., $\\operatorname { R } = \\Phi \\subset \\operatorname { A } \\times \\operatorname { A }$ \n\nDefinition 2 Arelation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A is related to every element of A, i.e., ${ \\mathrm { R } } = { \\mathrm { A } } \\times { \\mathrm { A } }$ \n\nBoth the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial relations. ■ \n\nExample 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R in A given by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( a , b ) : a$ is sister of $b \\}$ is the empty relation and $\\ R ^ { \\prime } = \\{ ( a , b ) :$ the difference between heights of $a$ and $^ { b }$ is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation. \n\nSolution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any student of the school. Hence, ${ \\mathrm { R } } = \\phi$ ，showing that R is the empty relation. It is also obvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be less than 3 meters. This shows that $\\mathrm { R ^ { \\prime } } = \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ is the universal relation. \n\nRemark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster method and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\}$ defined by R $= \\{ ( a , \\ b ) \\ : \\ b \\ = \\ a \\ + \\ 1 \\}$ is also expressed as $a$ R $^ { b }$ if and only if $b = a + 1$ by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient. \n\nIf $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ , we say that $a$ is related to $^ { b }$ and we denote it as $a \\mathrm { ~ R ~ } b$ \n\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics, is an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three types of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \n\nDefinition 3 A relation R in a set A is called \n\n(i) reflexive, if $( a , a ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ ,for every $a \\in \\mathbf { A }$   \n(ii) symmetric,if $( a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ implies that $( a _ { 2 } , a _ { 1 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { \\Omega } }$ for all $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } \\in \\mathbf { A }$   \n(ii) transitive,if $( a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( a _ { 2 } , a _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ implies that $( a _ { 1 } , a _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathtt { f } }$ for all $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } ,$ $a _ { _ 3 } \\in \\mathrm { A }$ \n\nDefinition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \n\nExample 2 Let Tbe the set of al triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by $\\mathbf { R } = \\{ ( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } ) : \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } \\}$ . Show that R is an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further, $( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } \\Rightarrow ( \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ Hence, R is symmetric. Moreover, $( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } )$ ， $( \\Gamma _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow \\Gamma _ { 1 }$ iscongruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } \\Longrightarrow ( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ Therefore,R is an equivalence relation. → \n\nExample 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ) : \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ is perpendicular to ${ \\mathrm { L } } _ { _ 2 } \\}$ . Show that $\\mathrm { R }$ is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive. \n\nSolution R is not reflexive,as aline $\\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ can not be perpendicular to itself,i.e., $( \\mathrm { L } _ { _ { 1 } } , \\mathrm { L } _ { _ { 1 } } )$ $\\not \\in \\mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ R is symmetric as $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ \n\n$\\Rightarrow$ $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ $\\Rightarrow$ $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ \n\nR is not transitive. Indeed, if $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 3 }$ ,then $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ can never be perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { _ 3 }$ In fact, $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ is parallel to $\\mathrm { L } _ { _ 3 } ,$ i.e., $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ but $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 3 } ) \\not \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ \n\nExample 4 Show that the relation R in the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ given by ${ \\mathrm R } = \\{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 )$ $( 3 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) \\}$ is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive. \n\nSolution R is reflexive, since $( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 )$ and (3,3) lie in R.Also, R is not symmetric, as $( 1 , 2 ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ but $( 2 , 1 ) \\notin \\mathrm { R }$ .Similarly, R is not transitive, as $( 1 , 2 ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ and $( 2 , 3 ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ but $( 1 , 3 ) \\not \\in { \\mathrm { R } }$ \n\nExample 5 Show that the relation R in the set $\\mathbf { Z }$ of integers given by \n\nis an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution R is reflexive, as 2 divides $( a - a )$ for all $a \\in \\mathbf { Z }$ .Further, if $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ then 2 divides $a - b$ .Therefore,2 divides $b - a$ Hence, $( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ ,which shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, if $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ then $a - b$ and $b - c$ are divisible by 2. Now, $a - c = ( a - b ) + ( b - c )$ is even (Why?). So, $( a - c )$ is divisible by 2. This shows that R is transitive. Thus,R is an equivalence relation in $\\mathbf { Z }$ \n\nIn Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as $( 0 , \\pm 2 )$ ， $( 0 , \\pm 4 )$ etc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to O, as $( 0 , \\pm 1 )$ ， $( 0 , \\pm 3 )$ etc., do not lie in R. Similarly, all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one. Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of Z satisfying following conditions: \n\n(i)All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to each other. (ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa. (ii) E and O are disjoint and $\\mathbf { Z } = \\operatorname { E } \\cup \\mathrm { O }$ 一 \n\nThe subset E is called the equivalence class containing zero and is denoted by [0]. Similarly, O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by[1]. Note that $[ 0 ] \\neq [ 1 ] , [ 0 ] = [ 2 r ]$ and $[ 1 ] = [ 2 r + 1 ] , r \\in { \\bf Z }$ . Infact, what we have seen above is true for an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence relation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ called partitions or subdivisions of X satisfying: \n\n(i）all elements of $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ are related to each other, for all i. (ii) no element of $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ is related to any element of $\\mathrm { A } _ { j }$ ， $i \\neq j$ (i) $\\cup \\mathtt { A } _ { j } = \\mathtt { X }$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { i } \\cap \\mathbf { A } _ { j } = \\boldsymbol \\Phi$ $i \\neq j$ \n\nThe subsets $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ are called equivalence classes. The interesting part of the situation is that we can go reverse also.For example, consider a subdivision of the set $\\mathbf { Z }$ given by three mutually disjoint subsets $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } , \\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { A } _ { 3 }$ whose union is $\\mathbf { Z }$ with \n\n$\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { Z } : x$ is a multiple of $3 \\} = \\{ . . . , - 6 , - 3 , 0 , 3 , 6 , . . . \\}$ $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { Z } : x - 1$ is a multiple of $3 \\} = \\{ . . . , - 5 , - 2 , 1 , 4 , 7 , . . . \\}$ $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { Z } : x - 2$ is a multiple of $3 \\} = \\{ . . . , - 4 , - 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , . . . \\}$ \n\nDefine a relation R in $\\mathbf { Z }$ given by $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( a , b ) : 3$ divides $a - b \\}$ . Following the arguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence relation. Also, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ coincides with the set of allintegers in $\\mathbf { Z }$ which are related to zero, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ coincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 }$ coincides with the set of all integers in $\\mathbf { Z }$ which are related to 2. Thus, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } = [ 0 ] , \\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } = [ 1 ]$ and ${ \\bf A } _ { 3 } = [ 2 ]$ In fact, A, = [3r], $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } ^ { } = [ 3 r ^ { + } 1 ]$ and ${ \\bf A } _ { 3 } = [ 3 r + 2 ] _ { \\ L }$ for all $r \\in \\mathbf { Z }$ \n\nExample 6 Let $\\mathrm { R }$ be the relation defined in the set $\\mathrm { A } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\}$ by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( a , b ) $ : both $a$ and $^ { b }$ are either odd or even}. Show that $\\mathrm { R }$ is an equivalence relation.Further, show that allthe elements of the subset $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ are related to each other and all the elements of the subset $\\{ 2 , 4 , 6 \\}$ are related to each other, but no element of the subset $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ is related to any element of the subset {2, 4, 6}. \n\nSolution Given any element $a$ in A, both $a$ and $a$ must be either odd or even, so that $( a , a ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ Further, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R } \\Rightarrow$ both $a$ and $^ { b }$ must be either odd or even $\\Rightarrow ( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ Similarly, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow$ all elements $a , b , c ,$ must be either even or odd simultaneously $\\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\operatorname { R } .$ Hence,R is an equivalence relation. Further, all the elements of $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ are related to each other, as all the elements of this subset are odd. Similarly,allthe elements of the subset $\\{ 2 , 4 , 6 \\}$ are related to each other, as all of them are even. Also, no element of the subset $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ can be related to any element of $\\{ 2 , 4 , 6 \\}$ , as elements of $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ are odd, while elements of {2, 4, 6} are even. \n\nEXERCISE 1.1 \n\n1．Determine whether each of the following relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive: \n\n(i) Relation R in the set $\\mathrm { A } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , 1 3 , 1 4 \\}$ defined as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : 3 x - y = 0 \\}$   \n(ii) Relation R in the set $\\mathbf { N }$ of natural numbers defined as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : y = x + 5$ and $x < 4 \\}$   \n(ii) Relation R in the set $\\mathrm { A } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\}$ as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : y { \\mathrm { ~ i s ~ d i v i s i b l e ~ b y ~ } } x \\}$   \n(iv) Relation R in the set $\\mathbf { Z }$ of all integers defined as $\\mathbb { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x - y$ is an integer}   \n(v) Relation R in the set A ofhuman beings in a town at a particular time given by (a) ${ \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x$ and $y$ work at the same place} (b) $\\mathtt { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x$ and y live in the same locality} (c） ${ \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x$ is exactly 7 cm taller than y} (d) $\\begin{array} { l } { { \\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x \\mathrm { ~ i s ~ w i f e ~ o f ~ } y \\} } } \\\\ { { \\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x \\mathrm { ~ i s ~ f a t h e r ~ o f ~ } y \\} } } \\end{array}$ (e) \n\n2.

As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and among other disciplines as well we would like to extend our study about function from where we finished earlier. In this section, we would like to study different types of functions. \n\nConsider the functions $f _ { 1 } , f _ { 2 } , f _ { 3 }$ and $f _ { 4 }$ given by the following diagrams. \n\nIn Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under the function $f _ { 1 }$ are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under $f _ { 2 }$ is same, namely $b$ .Further, there are some elements like $e$ and $f$ in $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 2 }$ which are not images of any element of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under $f _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ , while all elements of $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 3 }$ are images of some elements of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under $f _ { 3 }$ . The above observations lead to the following definitions: \n\nDefinition 5 A function f: $\\Chi \\to \\Upsilon$ is defined to be one-one (or injective),if the images of distinct elements of $\\mathrm { X }$ under $f$ are distinct, i.e., for every $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in \\mathrm { X } , f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } )$ implies $x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 }$ . Otherwise, $f$ is called many-one. \n\nThe function $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 4 }$ in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv)are one-one and the function $f _ { 2 }$ and $f _ { 3 }$ in Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one. \n\nDefinition 6 A function f $\\colon \\mathrm { X }  \\mathrm { Y }$ is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element of Y is the image of some element of $\\mathrm { X }$ under $f ,$ i.e., for every $y \\in \\mathrm { Y } ,$ there exists an element $x$ in $\\mathrm { X }$ such that $f ( x ) = y$ \n\nThe function $f _ { 3 }$ and $f _ { 4 }$ in Fig 1.2 (i), (iv) are onto and the function $f _ { 1 }$ in Fig 1.2 (i) is not onto as elements $e , f$ in $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 2 }$ are not the image of any element in $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 1 }$ under $f _ { 1 }$ \n\nRemark $f \\colon { \\mathrm { X } }  { \\mathrm { Y } }$ is onto if and only if Range of $\\mathrm { \\Delta } f = \\mathrm { Y } .$ \n\nDefinition 7 A function $f$ $\\mathrm { X } \\to \\mathrm { Y }$ is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if $f$ is both one-one and onto. \n\nThe function $f _ { 4 }$ in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto. \n\nExample 7 Let A be the set of all 50 students of Class X in a school. Let f : $\\mathbf A \\to \\mathbf N$ be function defined by $f ( x ) =$ roll number of the student $x .$ Show that $f$ is one-one but not onto. \n\nSolution No two different students of the class can have same roll number. Therefore, $f$ must be one-one. We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of students are from 1 to 50.This implies that 51 in Nis not roll number of any student of the class,so that 51 can not be image of any element of X under f. Hence, $f$ is not onto. \n\nExample 8 Show that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { N }  \\mathbf { N } ,$ given by $f ( x ) = 2 x .$ , is one-one but not onto. \n\nSolution The function $f$ is one-one, for $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow 2 x _ { 1 } = 2 x _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ Further, $f$ is not onto, as for $1 \\in \\mathbf { N } ,$ there does not exist any $x$ in $\\mathbf { N }$ such that $f ( x ) = 2 x = 1$ \n\nExample 9 Prove that the function f: $\\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } .$ given by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathscr { f } } ( \\boldsymbol { x } ) = 2 \\boldsymbol { x } ,$ is one-one and onto. Solution $f$ is one-one, as $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow 2 x _ { 1 } = 2 x _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ Also, given any real number $y$ in $\\mathrm { R }$ there xists $\\frac { y } { 2 }$ in R such hat $f ( \\frac { y } { 2 } ) = 2 . ( \\frac { y } { 2 } ) = y$ Hence $f$ is ot. \n\nExample 10 Show that the function f: $\\mathbf N \\to \\mathbf N$ given by $f ( 1 ) = f ( 2 ) = 1$ and $f ( x ) = x - 1$ for every $x > 2$ , is onto but not one-one. \n\nSolution $f$ is not one-one, as $f ( 1 ) = f ( 2 ) = 1 .$ But fis onto, as given any $y \\in \\mathbf { N } , y \\neq 1$ ， we can choose $x$ as $y + 1$ such that $f ( y + 1 ) = y + 1 - 1 = y .$ Also for $1 \\in \\mathbf { N } ,$ we have $f ( 1 ) = 1$ \n\nExample 11 Show that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } .$ defined as $f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 }$ , is neither one-one nor onto. \n\nSolution Since $f ( - 1 ) = 1 = f ( 1 ) , f$ is not oneone.Also, the element-2 in the co-domain Ris not image of any element $x$ in the domain R (Why?). Therefore $f$ is not onto. \n\nExample $^ { 1 2 }$ Show that $f \\colon \\mathbf { N }  \\mathbf { N } .$ given by \n\nThe image of 1 and $^ { - 1 }$ under $f$ is 1. \n\nis both one-one and onto. \n\nSolution Suppose $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } )$ .Note that if $x _ { 1 }$ is odd and $x _ { 2 }$ is even, then we will have $x _ { 1 } + 1 = x _ { 2 } - 1$ i.e., $x _ { 2 } - x _ { 1 } = 2$ which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of $\\dot { x } _ { 1 }$ being even and $x _ { 2 }$ being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore, both $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { _ 2 }$ must be either odd or even. Suppose both $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are odd. Then $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } + 1 = x _ { 2 } + 1 \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ Similarly, if both $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { _ 2 }$ are even, then also $f ( x _ { _ { 1 } } ) = f ( x _ { _ { 2 } } ) \\Rightarrow x _ { _ { 1 } } - 1 = x _ { _ { 2 } } - 1 \\Rightarrow x _ { _ { 1 } } = x _ { _ { 2 } }$ . Thus, $f$ is one-one. Also,any odd number $2 r + 1$ in the co-domain $\\mathbf { N }$ is the image of $2 r + 2$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N }$ and any even number $2 r$ in the co-domain $\\mathbf { N }$ is the image of $2 r - 1$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N } .$ Thus, $f$ is onto. \n\nExample 13 Show that an onto function $f \\colon \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}  \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ is always one-one. \n\nSolution Suppose $f$ is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the domain whose image in the co-domain is same.Also, the image of 3 under $f$ can be only one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the co-domain {1,2,3},showing that $f$ is not onto,a contradiction. Hence,fmust be one-one. \n\nExample 14 Show that a one-one function $f \\colon \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}  \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ must be onto. \n\nSolution Since $f$ is one-one, three elements of $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ must be taken to 3 different elements of the co-domain $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ under $f .$ Hence, $f$ has to be onto. \n\nRemark The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary finite set X, i.e., a one-one function $f \\colon X \\to X$ is necessarily onto and an onto map $f \\colon X \\to X$ is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X. In contrast to this, Examples 8 and 1O show that for an infinite set, this may not be true.In fact, this is a characteristic difference between a finite and an infinite set. \n\nEXERCISE 1.2 \n\n1． Show that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R } _ { * } \\to \\mathbf { R } _ { * }$ defined by $f ( x ) = { \\frac { 1 } { x } }$ is one-one and onto, where $\\mathbf { R } _ { * }$ is the set of all non-zero real numbers.

Show that the Modulus Function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } .$ given by $f ( x ) = | x | ,$ is neither oneone nor onto, where $\\mid x \\mid$ is $x ,$ if $x$ is positive or O and $| x | \\operatorname { i s } - x ,$ if $x$ is negative. \n\n5.

Justify your answer. \n\n11.Let $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } \\quad$ be defined as $f ( x ) = x ^ { 4 }$ .

Then the composition of $f$ and $g _ { \\mathrm { : } }$ , denoted by gof, is defined as the function gof : $\\mathbf A \\to \\mathbf C$ given by \n\nExample 15 Let $f \\colon \\{ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\}  \\{ 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 \\}$ and $g : \\{ 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 \\}  \\{ 7 , 1 1 , 1 5 \\}$ be functions defined as $f ( 2 ) = 3 , f ( 3 ) = 4 , f ( 4 ) = f ( 5 ) = 5$ and $g ( 3 ) = g ( 4 ) = 7$ and $g ( 5 ) = g ( 9 ) = 1 1$ Find gof. \n\nSolution We have $g o f ( 2 ) = \\ g ( f ( 2 ) ) = g ( 3 ) = 7 , g o f ( 3 ) = \\ g ( f ( 3 ) ) = g ( 4 ) = 7 ,$ $g o f ( 4 ) = \\ g ( f ( 4 ) ) = g ( 5 ) = 1 1$ and $g o f ( 5 ) = g ( 5 ) = 1 1 .$ ? \n\nExample 16 Find gof and fog, if $f$ ： $\\mathbf R \\to \\mathbf R$ and $g : \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R }$ are given by $f ( x ) = \\cos x$ and $g ( x ) = 3 x ^ { 2 }$ . Show that $g o f \\neq f o g$ \n\nSolution We have $g o f ( x ) = \\ g \\left( f ( x ) \\right) = g ( \\cos \\ x ) = 3$ $( \\cos \\ x ) ^ { 2 } = 3 \\ \\cos ^ { 2 } \\ x .$ Similarly, $f o g ( x ) = f ( g ( x ) ) = f ( 3 x ^ { 2 } ) = \\csc$ S $( 3 x ^ { 2 } )$ . Note that $3 \\mathrm { c o s } ^ { 2 } x \\neq \\cos 3 x ^ { 2 } .$ for $x = 0$ Hence, $g o f \\neq f o g$ \n\nDefinition 9 A function $f \\colon X \\to \\mathrm { Y }$ is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function $g : \\mathrm { Y } \\to \\mathrm { X }$ such that $g o f { = } \\mathrm { I _ { x } } \\mathrm { a n d } f o g { = } \\mathrm { I _ { y } } .$ The function $g$ is called the inverse off and is denoted by $f ^ { - 1 }$ \n\nThus, if $f$ is invertible, then $f$ must be one-one and onto and conversely, if $f$ is one-one and onto,then fmust be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a function $f$ to be invertible by showing that $f$ is one-one and onto, specially when the actual inverse of $f$ is not to be determined. \n\nExample 17 Let $f \\colon \\mathbf { N }  \\mathrm { Y }$ be a function defined as $f ( x ) = 4 x + 3$ ,where, $\\mathrm { Y } = \\{ y \\in \\mathbf { N } \\colon y = 4 x + 3$ for some $x \\in \\mathbf { N } \\}$ . Show that $f$ is invertible. Find the inverse. \n\nSolution Consider an arbitrary element $y$ of Y. By the definition of Y, $y = 4 x + 3$ for some $x$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N }$ . This shows that $x = \\frac { \\left( y - 3 \\right) } { 4 }$ Define $g : \\mathrm { Y }  \\mathbf { N }$ by \n\n$f o g ( y ) = f ( g ( y ) ) = f { \\left( \\frac { ( y - 3 ) } { 4 } \\right) } = \\frac { 4 \\left( y - 3 \\right) } { 4 } + 3 = y - 3 + 3 = y .$ Thishosatet $g o f \\mathrm { = I _ { N } }$ and $f o g = \\mathrm { I _ { y } } .$ , which implies that $f$ is invertible and $g$ is the inverse off. \n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 18 If $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ are equivalence relations in a set A, show that $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ is also an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution Since $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ are equivalence relations, $( a , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } { : }$ and $( a , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\ \\forall a \\in \\mathrm { A }$ This implies that $( a , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } , \\forall a .$ ，showing $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is reflexive. Further, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow$ $( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } { : }$ hence, $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is symmetric. Similarly, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathbb { R } _ { 2 }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $( a , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } .$ This shows that $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is transitive. Thus, $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is an equivalence relation. \n\nExample 19 Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers defined by $( x , y ) \\mathrm { R } \\left( u , \\nu \\right)$ if and only if $_ { x \\nu } = y u$ . Show that R is an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution Clearly, $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( x , y ) , \\ \\forall \\ ( x , y ) \\in \\textrm { A } .$ since $x y = y x$ This shows that R is reflexive. Further, $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( u , \\nu ) \\Rightarrow x \\nu = y u \\Rightarrow u y = \\nu x$ and hence $( u , \\nu ) \\textrm { R } ( x , y )$ This shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( u , \\nu )$ and $( u , \\nu ) \\operatorname { R } { ( a , b ) } \\Rightarrow x \\nu = y u$ and $u b = \\nu a \\Rightarrow x \\nu { \\frac { a } { u } } = y u { \\frac { a } { u } } \\Rightarrow x \\nu { \\frac { b } { \\nu } } = y u { \\frac { a } { u } } \\Rightarrow x b = y a$ and hence $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( a , b )$ . Thus,R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation. \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm { X } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\}$ .Let $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ be a relation in X given by $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x - y$ is divisible by 3} and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 2 }$ be another relation on X given by $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } = \\{ ( x , y ) \\colon \\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\} \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 3 , 6 , 9 \\} \\}$ . Show that ${ \\sf R } _ { 1 } = { \\sf R } _ { 2 }$ \n\nSolution Note that the characteristic of sets $\\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\} , \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ and $\\left\\{ 3 , \\ 6 , \\ 9 \\right\\}$ is that difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore, $( x , y ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\Rightarrow x - y$ is a multiple of $3 \\Rightarrow \\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 3 , 6 , 9 \\} \\Rightarrow ( x , y ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } .$ Hence, $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\subset \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ Similarly, $\\{ x , y \\} \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { _ { 2 } } \\Rightarrow \\{ x , y \\}$ $\\textsf { C } \\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 3 , 6 , 9 \\} \\Rightarrow x - y$ is divisible by $3 \\Rightarrow \\{ x , y \\} \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { 1 }$ This shows that $\\mathsf { R } _ { 2 } \\subset \\mathsf { R } _ { 1 }$ Hence, ${ \\sf R } _ { 1 } = { \\sf R } _ { 2 }$ \n\nExample 21 Lety $f \\colon \\mathrm { X }  \\mathrm { Y }$ be a function. Define a relation R in X given by $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( a , b ) \\colon f ( a ) = f ( b ) \\} .$ Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not. \n\nSolution For every $a \\in \\mathrm { X }$ $( a , a ) \\in \\mathbb { R } .$ since $f ( a ) = f ( a )$ ，showing that R is reflexive. Similarly, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow f ( a ) = f ( b ) \\Rightarrow f ( b ) = f ( a ) \\Rightarrow ( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ Therefore,R is symmetric.Further, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow f ( a ) = f ( b )$ and $f ( b ) = f ( c ) \\Rightarrow f ( a )$ $\\mathbf { \\sigma } = f ( c ) \\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\mathbb { R } .$ ,which implies that R is transitive. Hence,R is an equivalence relation. 一 \n\nExample 22 Find the number of all one-one functions from set $A = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ to itself. \n\nSolution One-one function from $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ to itself is simply a permutation on three symbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ to itself is same as total number of permutations on three symbols 1,2, 3 which is $3 ! = 6$ \n\nExample 23 Let $A = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\} .$ Then show that the number ofrelations containing $( 1 , 2 )$ and (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three. \n\nSolution The smallest relation $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ containing $( 1 , 2 )$ and $( 2 , 3 )$ which is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is $\\{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) \\}$ .Now, if we add the pair (2, 1) to $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ to get $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ , then the relation $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ will be reflexive, transitive but not symmetric. Similarly, we can obtain $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ by adding $( 3 , 2 )$ to $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ to get the desired relation. However, we can not add two pairs (2,1), (3,2) or single pair $( 3 , 1 )$ to $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ at a time, as by doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity and in the process, the relation willbecome symmetric also which is not required. Thus, the total number of desired relations is three. \n\nExample 24 Show that the number ofequivalence relation in the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ containing (1,2) and (2, 1) is two. \n\nSolution The smallest equivalence relation $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ containing (1,2) and (2,1) is $\\{ ( 1 , 1 )$ (2, 2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2,3), (3,2), (1, 3) and (3,1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ , then for symmetry we must add (3,2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add $( 1 , 3 )$ and (3,1). Thus,the only equivalence relation bigger than $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ is the universal relation. This shows that the total number of equivalence relations containing $( 1 , 2 )$ and $( 2 , 1 )$ is two. \n\nExample 25 Consider the identity function $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } : \\mathbf { N } \\to \\mathbf { N }$ defined as $\\operatorname { I } _ { \\mathbf { N } } \\left( x \\right) = x \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbf { N } .$ Show that although $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ is onto but $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } : \\mathbf { N }  \\mathbf { N }$ defined as \n\nSolution Clearly $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathbf { N } }$ is onto.But $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { v } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { v } }$ is not onto, as we can find an element 3 in the co-domain $\\mathbf { N }$ such that there does not exist any $x$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N }$ with $( \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } ) \\left( x \\right) = 2 x = 3$ \n\nExample 26 Consider a function $f : [ 0 , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } ]  \\mathbf { R }$ given by $f ( x ) = \\sin { x }$ and $g : [ 0 , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } ]  \\mathbf { R }$ given by $g ( x ) = \\cos x .$ Show that $f$ and $_ g$ are n-one sut $f + g$ is not one-one. 一 \n\nSolution Since for any two distinct elements $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ in $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ si $x _ { 1 } \\neq \\sin x _ { 2 }$ and cos $x _ { 1 } \\neq \\cos x _ { 2 }$ both $f$ and $g$ must be one-one.But $\\left( f + g \\right) \\left( 0 \\right) = \\sin 0 + \\cos 0 = 1$ and $( f + g ) \\bigg ( \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\bigg ) = \\sin \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } + \\cos \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } = 1$ =1. Therefore,f+ g is not one-one.

This is the characteristic property of a finite set. This is not true for infinite set \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from R. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript \"Geometrie” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power $x ^ { n }$ of a variable $x$ while studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellpse. James Gregory (i636-1675) in his work “ Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura” (1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by successive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G. W. Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de functionibus” writen in 1673 used the word ‘function’to mean a quantity varying from point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However, in his manuscript “Historia’ (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean quantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function of $x '$ . John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation $\\phi x$ for the first time in 1718 to indicate a function of $x$ But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, $\\boldsymbol { \\Phi }$ ， $\\boldsymbol { \\Psi }$ ...to represent functions was made by Leonhard Euler(1707-1783) in 1734 in the first part of his manuscript “Analysis Infinitorium\". Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) published his manuscripts “Theorie des functions analytiques\" in 1793, where he discussed about analytic function and used the notion $f ( x ) , \\operatorname { F } ( x ) .$ $\\phi ( x )$ 'etc. for different function of $x$ . Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet (1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used til the set theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet in a rigorous manner.",

    "content": "INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS \n\nMathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of self-evident things. - FELIX KLEIN \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nIn Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function $f ,$ denoted by $f ^ { - 1 }$ ,exists iffis one-one and onto. There are many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and hence we can not talk of their inverses.In Class XI, we studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their inverses do not exist.In this chapter, we shall study about the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and observe their behaviour through graphical representations. Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed. \n\nThe inverse trigonometric functions play an important role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals. \n\nThe concepts ofinverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering. \n\n2.2 Basic Concepts \n\nIn Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows: sine function, i.e., sine : $\\mathbf { R }  [ - 1 , 1 ]$ cosine function, i.e., cos $: \\mathbf { R }  [ - 1 , 1 ]$ tangentfunction,i.e.ta $\\operatorname { 1 } : \\mathbf { R } - \\{ { \\boldsymbol { x } } : { \\boldsymbol { x } } = ( 2 n + 1 ) ~ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}  \\mathbf { R }$ cotangent function, i.e., $\\cot : \\mathbf { R } - \\{ \\textit { x } : x = n \\pi , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}  \\mathbf { R }$ secant function, i.e., $\\sec : \\mathbf { R } - \\left\\{ x : x = ( 2 n + 1 ) \\ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\right\\} \\to \\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ cosecant function, i.e., cosec $: \\mathbf { R } - \\{ \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } } : \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } } = n \\pi , \\ n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}  \\mathbf { R } - ( - \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { 1 } } , \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { 1 } } )$ \n\nWe have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : $\\mathrm { X } { \\to } \\mathrm { Y }$ such that $f ( x ) = y$ is one-one and onto, then we can define a unique function $g : \\mathrm { Y } \\to \\mathrm { X }$ such that $g ( y ) = x ,$ where $x \\in \\mathrm { X }$ and $y = f ( x ) , y \\in \\mathrm { Y } .$ Here, the domain of $g =$ range offand the range of $g =$ domain of $f .$ The function $_ g$ is called the inverse of $f$ and is denoted by $f ^ { - 1 }$ .Further, $g$ is also one-one and onto and inverse of $_ g$ is $f .$ Thus, $\\begin{array} { r } { g ^ { - 1 } = ( f ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { - 1 } = f . } \\end{array}$ We also have \n\nand \n\nSince the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the closed interval $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . If we restrict its domain to $\\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] .$ then it becomes one-one and onto with range $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . Actually, sine function restricted to any of the intervals [-3ππ] 2'2][2'2 一π 元 , [ππ] 2 2 etc., is one-one and its range is $[ - 1 , \\ 1 ]$ .We can, therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals.We denote the inverse of sine function by $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ (arc sine function). Thus, $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ is a function whose domain is $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ and range could be any of the intervals $\\left[ { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] , \\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ or $\\left[ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ ， and so on. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ . The branch with range $\\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ is called the principal value branch, whereas other intervals as range give different branches of $\\mathrm { s i n ^ { - 1 } }$ . When we refer to the function $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ , we take it as the function whose domain is $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ and range is $\\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ We write $\\sin ^ { - 1 } : [ - 1 , 1 ]  [ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } ]$ \n\nFrom the definition of the inverse functions,it follows that sin $( \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ) = x$ if $- \\ : 1 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and sin-1 $( \\sin x ) = x$ if $- { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } { \\leq x \\leq \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } }$ In other words, if $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ,$ then sin $y = x$ 2 \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) We know from Chapter 1, that if $y = f ( x )$ is an invertible function, then $x = f ^ { - 1 } \\left( y \\right)$ Thus, the graph of $\\mathrm { s i n ^ { - 1 } }$ function can be obtained from the graph of original function by interchanging $x$ and $y$ axes, i.e., if $( a , b )$ is a point on the graph of sine function, then $( b , a )$ becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ can be obtained from the graph of $y = \\sin x$ by interchanging $x$ and $y$ axes. The graphs of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\bar { \\sin ^ { - 1 } x }$ are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (i), (ii). The dark portion of the graph of $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ represent the principal value branch. \n\n(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along the line $y = x$ .This can be visualised by looking the graphs of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii). \n\nLike sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of äall real numbers and range is the set $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . If we restrict the domain of cosine function to $[ 0 , \\pi ]$ ,then it becomes one-one and onto with range $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . Actually, cosine function restricted to any of the intervals $[ - \\pi , 0 ]$ ， $[ 0 , \\pi ] , [ \\pi , 2 \\pi ]$ etc., is bijective with range as $[ - 1 , \\ 1 ]$ . We can, therefore,define the inverse of cosine function in each of these intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ (arc cosine function). \n\nThus, $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ is a function whose domain is $[ - 1 , \\ 1 ]$ and range could be any of the intervals $[ - \\pi , \\ 0 ] , \\ [ 0 , \\ \\pi ] , \\ [ \\pi , \\ 2 \\pi ]$ etc. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ . The branch with range $[ 0 , \\pi ]$ is called the principal value branch of the function $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ . We write \n\nThe graph of the function given by $y = \\cos ^ { - 1 } x$ can be drawn in the same way as discussed about the graph of $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x .$ The graphs of $y = \\cos x $ and $y = \\cos ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.2 (i) and (i). \n\n5元 元 X'← 2 π 2π Y rep y= cos x Fig 2.2 (i) \n\nLet us now discuss cosec $^ { - 1 } x$ and $\\sec ^ { - 1 } x$ as follows: \n\nSince, cosec $x = { \\frac { 1 } { \\sin x } }$ the domain of the cosec function is the set $\\{ x : x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and $x \\neq n \\pi$ $n \\in { \\bf Z } \\}$ and the range is the set $\\{ y : y \\in \\mathbf { R }$ $y \\geq 1$ or $y \\leq - 1 \\}$ i.e., the set $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ . It means that $y = \\csc x$ assumes all real values except $- 1 < y < 1$ and is not defined for integral multiple of $\\pi$ .If we restrict the domain of cosec function to $\\left[ - \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right] - \\{ 0 \\}$ theo $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ Actually, Cosec function restricted to any of the intervals $\\left[ \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } \\right] - \\{ - \\pi \\} , \\left[ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right] - \\{ 0 \\} ,$ $\\left[ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\{ \\pi \\}$ i $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ \n\n$\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ be any of the intervals $\\left[ { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\left\\{ - \\pi \\right\\} , \\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\left\\{ 0 \\right\\} , \\left[ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\left\\{ \\pi \\right\\}$ etc. The function corresponding to the range ${ \\bigg [ } { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } { \\bigg ] } - \\{ 0 \\}$ of cosec-1. We thus have principal branch as \n\nThe graphs of $y = \\csc x$ and $y = \\cos \\operatorname { e c } ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.3 (i), (ii). \n\nAlso, since sec $x = { \\frac { 1 } { \\cos x } }$ , the domain of $y = \\sec x$ is the set $\\mathbf { R } - \\left\\{ x : x = \\left( 2 n + 1 \\right) \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } . \\right.$ $n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}$ and range is the set $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ . It means that sec (secant function) assumes all real values except $- 1 < y < 1$ and is not defined for odd multiples of $\\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ If we restrict the domain of secant functionto $[ 0 , \\pi ] - \\{ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\}$ ,then itis one-oneandontowith its range as the set $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ . Actually, secant function restricted to any of the intervals $[ - \\pi , 0 ] - \\{ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } \\} , [ 0 , \\pi ] - \\left\\{ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right\\} , [ \\pi , 2 \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } \\}$ etc., is bijective and its range is $\\mathbf { R } - \\{ - 1 , 1 \\}$ .Thus $\\sec ^ { - 1 }$ can be defined as a function whose domain is $\\mathbf { R } { - } \\left( { - } 1 , 1 \\right)$ and range could be any of he intervals $[ - \\pi , 0 ] - \\{ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } \\} , [ 0 , \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\} , [ \\pi , 2 \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } \\}$ etc. Corresponding to each of these intervals, we get different branches of the function sec-1. The branch with range $[ 0 , \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\}$ is called the principal value branch of the function $\\sec ^ { - 1 }$ . We thus have \n\nThe graphs of the functions $y = \\sec x$ and $y = \\sec ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.4 (i), (i). \n\nFinally, we now discuss tan-1 and cot-1 \n\nWe know that the domain of the tan function (tangent function) is the set $\\{ x : x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and $x \\neq ( 2 n + 1 ) \\ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}$ andterangisReansttcin is notdefinedforodduliples f ${ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } .$ If we restrict the domain of tangent function to $\\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ , then it is one-one and onto with its range as $\\mathbf { R }$ Actually, tangent function restricted to any of the intervals $\\left( { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ etc., is bijective and its range is R. Thus tan-1 can be defined as a function whose domain is $\\mathbf { R }$ and range could be any of the intervals $\\left( { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ and so on. These intervals give diferent branches of the function tan-1.The branch with range $\\left( \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right)$ is called the principal value branch of the function tan-1. \n\nWe thus have \n\nThe graphs of the function $y = \\tan x $ and $y = \\tan ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.5 (i), (ii). \n\nWe know that domain of the cot function (cotangent function） is the set $\\{ x : x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and $x \\neq n \\pi , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}$ and range is R. It means that cotangent function is not defined for integral multiples of $\\pi .$ . If we restrict the domain of cotangent function to $( 0 , \\pi )$ , then it is bijective with and its range as R.In fact, cotangent function restricted to any of the intervals $( - \\pi , 0 ) , ( 0 , \\pi ) , ( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$ etc., is bijective and its range is R. Thus cot-l can be defined as a function whose domain is the R and range as any of the intervals $( - \\pi , 0 ) , ( 0 , \\pi ) , ( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$ etc. These intervals give different branches of the function cot-1. The function with range $( 0 , \\pi )$ is called the principal value branch of the function cot-1. We thus have \n\nThe graphs of $y = \\cot x $ and $y = \\cot ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.6 (i), (ii). \n\nThe following table gives the inverse trigonometric function (principal value branches) along with their domains and ranges. \n\nNote \n\n1. $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ should not be confused with $( \\sin x ) ^ { - 1 }$ . In fact $( \\sin x ) ^ { - 1 } = { \\frac { 1 } { \\sin x } }$ and similarly for other trigonometric functions.   \n2. Whenever no branch of an inverse trigonometric functions is mentioned, we mean the principal value branch of that function.   \n3. The value of an inverse trigonometric functions which lies in the range of principal branch is called the principal value of that inverse trigonometric functions. \n\nWe now consider some examples: \n\nWe know that the range of the principal value branch of $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ is $\\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ and $\\sin \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } } \\right) = { \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } }$ . Therefore, principal value of $\\sin ^ { - 1 } \\left( { \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } } \\right) { \\mathrm { i s ~ } } { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } }$ Example 2 Find the principal value of cot-l $\\left( { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\right)$ R Solution Let cot- $\\left( { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\right) = y$ =y. Then, \n\nWe know that the range of principal value branch of cot-1 is $( 0 , \\pi )$ and cot $\\left( { \\frac { 2 \\pi } { 3 } } \\right) = { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } }$ Hence, principal value of cot-1 $\\left( { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\right)$ is $\\frac { 2 \\pi } { 3 }$ \n\nEXERCISE 2.1 \n\nFind the principal values of the following: \n\n1.sm([） 2( 3.cosec-1 (2)   \n4. tan-1 (-√3) 6. tan-1 (-1) \n\n8.cot1 (3) $\\cdot \\cos ^ { - 1 } \\left( - { \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } } \\right)$ \n\n10. $\\mathsf { c o s e c } ^ { - 1 } \\ ( \\mathsf { \\Sigma } _ { - } \\sqrt { 2 } \\ )$ \n\nFind the values of the following: \n\n$\\tan ^ { - 1 } ( 1 ) + \\cos ^ { - 1 } - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } + \\sin ^ { - 1 } - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } }$ 1 1   \n11. 12. cos-1 2 +2 sin-1 2 \n\n13.If $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x = y ;$ then \n\n(A) $0 \\leq y \\leq \\pi$ (B) ≤y≤ (C) $0 < y < \\pi$ (D) 2 元 <y< \n\n14. $\\tan ^ { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } - \\sec ^ { - 1 } \\left( - 2 \\right)$ is equal to \n\n(A）π (B) $- { \\frac { \\pi } { 3 } }$ 元 (D） 2 \n\n2.3 Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions \n\nIn this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse trigonometric functions.In fact, they will be valid only for some values of $x$ for which inverse trigonometric functions are defined.We will not go into the details of these values of $x$ in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook. \n\nLet us recall that if $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ,$ then $x = \\sin y$ and if $x = \\sin y$ ,then $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ This is equivalent to Y \n\nFor suitable values of domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric functions. \n\nWe now consider some examples. \n\nExample 3 Show that \n\nSolution \n\n(i) Let $x = \\sin \\theta$ Then $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x = 0$ .We have \n\n(i)Take $x = \\cos \\theta$ , then proceeding as above, we get, $\\sin ^ { - 1 } \\left( 2 x { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } \\right) = 2 \\cos ^ { - 1 } x$ \n\nExample 4 Express tan-1 1-snx ， $\\frac { \\cdot 3 \\pi } { 2 } < x < \\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ in the simplest form. \n\nSolution We write \n\n$\\cot ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } - 1 } } \\right) , ~ x > 1$ \n\nSolution Let $x = \\sec \\theta$ then ${ \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } - 1 } } = { \\sqrt { \\sec ^ { 2 } \\theta - 1 } } = \\tan \\theta$ \n\nTherefore, cot-1. $\\cot ^ { - 1 } \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } - 1 } } = \\cot ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\cot \\theta \\right) = \\Theta = \\sec ^ { - 1 } x ,$ which is the simplest form. \n\nEXERCISE 2.2 \n\nProve the following: \n\nWrite the following functions in the simplest form: \n\n3. $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\frac { \\sqrt { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } - 1 } { x } , x \\neq 0 , 4 . } \\\\ & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\left( \\displaystyle \\frac { \\cos x - \\sin x } { \\cos x + \\sin x } \\right) , \\displaystyle \\frac { - \\pi } { 4 } < x < \\displaystyle \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 4 } } \\\\ & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\frac { x } { \\sqrt { a ^ { 2 } - x ^ { 2 } } } , | x | < a } \\\\ & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\left( \\displaystyle \\frac { 3 a ^ { 2 } x - x ^ { 3 } } { a ^ { 3 } - 3 a ^ { 2 } } \\right) , a > 0 , \\displaystyle \\frac { - a } { \\sqrt { 3 } } < x < \\displaystyle \\frac { a } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\end{array}$ tan- 1-cosx ,0<x<π   \n5.   \n6 \n\nFind the values of each ofthe following: \n\nFind the values of each of the expressions in Exercises 16 to 18. \n\n11 $\\tan ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\tan { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 4 } } \\right)$ \n\n13 $\\cos ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\cos { \\frac { 7 \\pi } { 6 } } \\right)$ \n\n（A) $\\frac { 7 \\pi } { 6 }$ $\\frac { 5 \\pi } { 6 }$ （C） (D)\n\n14. $\\sin \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 3 } } - \\sin ^ { - 1 } ( - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } ) \\right)$ \n\n$\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ C (D）1\n\n15. $\\tan ^ { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } - \\cot ^ { - 1 } ( - { \\sqrt { 3 } } )$ is equal to \n\n(A）π B (D） 2√3\n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 6 Find the value of $\\sin ^ { - 1 } ( \\sin \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 5 } )$ \n\nSolution We know that $\\sin ^ { - 1 } ( \\sin x ) = x$ .

The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I (600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II(1i14 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry. All this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world. \n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to mathematics. \n\nBhaskara I(about 6Oo A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa contains a proof for the expansion of sin $\\left( \\mathsf { A } + \\mathsf { B } \\right)$ . Exact expression for sines or cosines of $1 8 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $3 6 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $5 4 ^ { \\circ }$ $7 2 ^ { \\circ }$ , etc., were given by Bhaskara II. \n\nThe symbols $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ ， $\\cos ^ { - 1 } { x } ,$ etc., for arc $\\sin x .$ arc $\\cos x ,$ etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales (about $6 0 0 \\mathrm { B . C . }$ ) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios: \n\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles.Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.",

    "content": "The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom. - CANTOR \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics.Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices far exceeds that use.Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology,modern psychology and industrial management. \n\nIn this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra. \n\n3.2 Matrix \n\nSuppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside[] is the number of notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens.We may express it as [15 6] with the understanding that first number inside[] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number ofpens possessed by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which is as follows: \n\nRadha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens, Fauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens, Simran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens. \n\nNow this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows: \n\nand this can be expressed as \n\n15 First row NCERT Second row Third row 个 First Second Column Column \n\nor \n\n? \n\nRadha \n\nNotebooks 10 13   \nPens 2 5 \n\nwhich can be expressed as: \n\n15 10 13 First row 6 2 5 $\\gets$ Second row → → → First Second Third Column Column Column \n\nIn the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. Similarly,in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a matrix. Formally, we define matrix as: \n\nDefinition 1 A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix. \n\nWe denote matrices by capital letters.The following are some examples of matrices: \n\nIn the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2 rows and 3 columns. \n\n3.2.1 Order of a matrix \n\nA matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order $m \\times n$ or simply $m \\times n$ matrix (read as an m by $n$ matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we have A as $3 \\times 2$ matrix, B as $3 \\times 3$ matrix and C as $2 \\times 3$ matrix.We observe that A has $3 \\times 2 = 6$ elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively. \n\nIn general, an $m \\times n$ matrix has the following rectangular array: \n\nor $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times n } , 1 \\leq i \\leq m , 1 \\leq j \\leq n i , j \\in \\mathrm { N }$ \n\nThus the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row consists of the elements $a _ { { } _ { i 1 } } , a _ { { } _ { i 2 } } , a _ { { } _ { i 3 } } { } _ { \\cdots } , a _ { { } _ { i n } } ,$ while the $j ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ column consists of the elements alj, a2j, aj., ämj \n\nIn general $a _ { _ { i j } } ^ { \\phantom { } } ,$ is an element lying in the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row and $j ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ column. We can also call it as the $( i , j ) ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ element of A. The number of elements in an $m \\times n$ matrix will be equal to mn. \n\nNote In this chapter \n\n1.We shalfollow the notation,amely $\\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times n }$ to indicate that A is a matrix of order $m \\times n$   \n2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or functions taking real values. \n\nWe can also represent any point $( x , y )$ in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as $\\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { x } \\\\ { y } \\end{array} \\right] ( \\mathrm { o r } [ x , y ] )$ Tor exmpl giat $\\mathrm { P } ( 0 , 1 )$ \n\nObserve that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear figure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices A (1, 0),B (3,2),C(1, 3),D $( - 1 , 2 )$ \n\nNow, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as \n\nThus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in a plane. \n\nNow, let us consider some examples. \n\nExample 1 Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women workers in three factories I, II and III \n\nRepresent the above information in the form of a $3 \\times 2$ matrix. What does the entry in the third row and second column represent? \n\nSolution The information is represented in the form of a $3 \\times 2$ matrix as follows: \n\nThe entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women workers in factory III. \n\nExample 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? \n\nSolution We know that if a matrix is of order $m \\times n$ ,it has mn elements.Thus,to find all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural numbers, whose product is 8. \n\nThus, all possible ordered pairs are $( 1 , 8 ) , ( 8 , 1 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 4 )$ \n\nHence,possible orders are $1 \\times 8$ $8 \\times 1$ $4 \\times 2 , 2 \\times 4$ \n\nExample 3 Construct a3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by dj = $a _ { i j } = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } | i - 3 j |$ \n\nSolution In general a $3 \\times 2$ matrix is given by $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathrm { A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { a _ { 1 1 } } & { a _ { 1 2 } } \\\\ { a _ { 2 1 } } & { a _ { 2 2 } } \\\\ { a _ { 3 1 } } & { a _ { 3 2 } } \\end{array} \\right] . } \\end{array}$ \n\nNow \n\nTherefore \n\nHence the required matrix is given by $\\mathbf { A } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { { \\frac { 5 } { 2 } } } \\\\ { { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ \n\n3.3 Types of Matrices \n\nIn this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices. \n\n(i) Column matrix \n\nA matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column. \n\n0 √3 For example, $\\mathbf { A } = { \\harpoonright _ { - 1 } }$ is a column matrix of order $4 \\times 1$ [1/2] \n\nIn general, $\\mathrm { \\bf A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times 1 }$ is a column matrix of order $m \\times 1$ \n\n(ii) Row matrix \n\nA matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row. For example, $B = \\left[ - \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\sqrt { 5 } 2 3 \\right] _ { 1 }$ is a row matrix. ×4 In general, $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { i j } ] _ { 1 \\times n }$ is a row matrix of order $1 \\times n$ \n\n(ii) Square matrix \n\nA matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is said to be a square matrix. Thus an $m \\times n$ matrix is said to be a square matrix if $m = n$ and is known as a square matrix of order $ { { ^ \\circ } n \\mathrm { ~ } }$ \n\n3 For example A = 3 3√2 is a square matrix of order 3. 2 4 -1 \n\nIn genera, $\\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times m }$ is a square matrix of order $m$ $\\overline { { \\mathbf { 1 0 t e } } } \\mathrm { [ f } \\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ is a square matrix of order $n$ , then elements (entries) $a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 1 } , a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 2 2 } , . . . , a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle n n }$ are said to constitute the diagonal, of the matrix A. Thus, if $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { c c c } { 1 } & { - 3 } & { 1 } \\\\ { 2 } & { 4 } & { - 1 } \\\\ { 3 } & { 5 } & { 6 } \\end{array} \\right] . } \\end{array}$ Then the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6. \n\n(iv) Diagonal matrix \n\nA square matrix $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times m }$ is said tobeadiagonal matrix ifal its non diagonal elementsarezero,thatisamatrix B=i is said to be a diagonal matrix if $b _ { _ { i j } } = 0$ ,when $i \\neq j$ \n\nFor example, $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { A } = [ 4 ] , \\ \\mathbf { B } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { - 1 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } \\end{array} \\right] , \\ \\mathbf { C } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l l } { - 1 . 1 } & { 0 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { 3 } \\end{array} \\right] , } \\end{array}$ are diga aieses \n\nof order 1,2,3,respectively. \n\n(v) Scalar matrix \n\nA diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix ifits diagonal elements are equa, that is,asquare matrixB=] is said to be a scalar matrix if \n\nFor example \n\nare calar matrices of order 1,2 and 3,respectively. \n\n(vi) Identity matrix \n\nA square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero is called an identity matrix. In other words, the square matrix ${ \\bf A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { n \\times n }$ is an \n\nidentity matrix, if $a _ { i j } = \\left\\{ { \\begin{array} { l l l l l } { { 1 } } & { { \\mathrm { i f } } } & { { i = j } } \\\\ { { 0 } } & { { \\mathrm { i f } } } & { { i \\neq j } } \\end{array} } \\right. .$ \n\nWe denote the identity matrix of order $n$ by $\\mathrm { I } _ { n } .$ When order is clear from the context, we simply write it as I. \n\nFor example [1], ${ \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] } , { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l l } { 1 } & { 0 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ are identity matrices of order 1,2 and 3, respectively. \n\nObserve that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when $k = 1$ But every identity matrix is clearly a scalar matrix. \n\n(vii) Zero matrix \n\nA matrix is said to be zero matrix or null matrix if all its elements are zero. For example,[0], [0 ${ \\left[ 0 \\quad 0 \\right] } , { \\left[ 0 \\quad 0 \\quad 0 \\right] } , \\left[ 0 , 0 \\right]$ 0o]'000],[O,0]are allzero matrices.We denote zero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context. \n\n3.3.1 Equality of matrices \n\nDefinition 2 Two matrices $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ and $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { _ { i j } } ]$ are said to be equal if \n\n(i) they are of the same order   \n(ii)each element of A is equal to the corresponding element ofB, that is $a _ { _ { i j } } = b _ { _ { i j } }$ for all $i$ and $j$ \n\nFor example, $\\left[ { \\begin{array} { c c } { 2 } & { 3 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} } \\right] { \\mathrm { { a n d } } } \\left[ { 2 } \\quad 3 \\right]$ are equal matrices but ${ \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 3 } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] } { \\mathrm { a n d } } { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 2 } & { 3 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] }$ are not equal matrices. Symbolically, if two matrices A and B are equal, we write $\\mathrm { A } = \\mathrm { B }$ \n\nFind the values of $a , b , c , x , y$ and $z$ \n\nSolution As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements must be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get \n\nSimplifying, we get \n\nExample 5 Find the values of $a , b , c ,$ and $d$ from the following equation: \n\nSolution By equality of two matrices, equating the corresponding elements, we get \n\nSolving these equations, we get \n\nEXERCISE 3.1 \n\n(i) The order of the matrix, (ii)  The number of elements, (ii) Write the elements al3, a21, a33, a24 a23 \n\n2. If a matrix has 24 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? What, if it has 13 elements? \n\n3. If a matrix has 18 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? What, if it has 5 elements? \n\n4. Construct a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ , whose elements are given by: \n\ni $a _ { i j } = \\frac { ( i + ( j ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \\quad \\quad ( \\mathrm { i i } ) \\quad a _ { i j } = \\frac { i } { j }$ $a _ { i j } = \\frac { ( i + 2 j ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 }$ \n\n5. Construct a $3 \\times 4$ matrix, whose elements are given by: \n\n6． Find the values of $x , y$ and $z$ from the following equations: \n\n7． Find the value of $a , b , c$ and $d$ from the equation: \n\n8. $\\mathbf { A } = \\left[ a _ { i j } \\right] _ { m \\times n | }$ is a square matrix, if \n\n(A) $\\ b { m } < \\ b { n } \\qquad \\mathrm { ( B ) } \\ \\ b { m } > \\ b { n }$ (C) $m = n$ (D） None of these\n\n9.

Each factory produces sport shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below: \n\nSuppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price category.

Therefore, addition of A and B is defined and is given by \n\nNote \n\n1. We emphasise that if A and B are not of the same order, then $\\mathrm { A } + \\mathrm { B }$ is not defined.

We observe that, for multiplication of two matrices Aand B, the number of columns in A should be equal to the number of rows in B. Furthermore for geting the elements of the product matrix, we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum. Formally, we define multiplication of matrices as follows: \n\nThe product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B. Let $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix and $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { j k } ]$ be an $n \\times p$ matrix. Then the product of the matrices Aand B is the matrix C of order $m \\times p$ To get the $( i , k ) ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ element $c _ { _ { i k } }$ of the matrix C, we take the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row of A and $k ^ { \\mathrm { { t h } } }$ column of B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words, if $\\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times n } , \\mathbf { B } = [ b _ { j k } ] _ { n \\times p } ,$ then the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row of A is $[ a _ { i 1 } ^ { \\phantom { } } a _ { i 2 } ^ { \\phantom { } } \\dots a _ { i n } ^ { \\phantom { } } ]$ and the $k ^ { \\mathrm { { t h } } }$ column of \n\nThe matrix $\\mathrm { C } = \\left[ c _ { i k } \\right] _ { m \\times p }$ is the product of A and B. \n\nFor xapg. $\\mathbf { C } = \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r r } { 1 } & { - 1 } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 3 } & { 4 } \\end{array} } \\right]$ and $\\mathrm { D } = \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r } { 2 } & { 7 } \\\\ { - 1 } & { 1 } \\\\ { 5 } & { - 4 } \\end{array} } \\right] .$ \n\nand is given by $\\mathrm { C D } = \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r r } { 1 } & { - 1 } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 3 } & { 4 } \\end{array} } \\right] \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r } { 2 } & { 7 } \\\\ { - 1 } & { 1 } \\\\ { 5 } & { - 4 } \\end{array} } \\right] .$ Thisisa $2 \\times 2$ mati i whih eah \n\nentry is the sum of the products across some row of C with the corresponding entries down some column of D.

Hence AB is defined. Now \n\nRemark If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3) rows. IfA,B are, respectively $m \\times n$ $k \\times l$ matrices, then both AB and BA are defined if and only if $n = k$ and $l = m$ . In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the same order, then both AB and BA are defined. \n\nNon-commutativity of multiplication of matrices \n\nNow, we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not necessary that $\\mathrm { A B } = \\mathrm { B A }$ \n\nExample 3 1f $\\mathbf { A } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l l } { 1 } & { - 2 } & { 3 } \\\\ { - 4 } & { 2 } & { 5 } \\end{array} \\right] }$ and $\\mathbf { B } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { 2 } \\end{array} \\right. } 3 { \\sqrt { \\mathbf { B } } } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { } \\\\ { 4 } \\end{array} \\right. } 5$ then find AB, BA. Show that $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A } .$ 1 -he \n\nSolution Since A is a $2 \\times 3$ matrix and $\\mathrm { B }$ is $3 \\times 2$ matrix. Hence AB and BA are both defined and are matrices of order $2 \\times 2$ and $3 \\times 3$ , respectively. Note that \n\nClearly $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A }$ \n\nIn the above example both AB and BA are of different order and so $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A }$ .But one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same order. But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of same order they may not be same. \n\nand \n\nThus matrix multiplication is not commutative. \n\nNote This does not mean that $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A }$ for every pair of matrices A, B for which AB and BA, are defined. For instance, \n\nObserve that multiplication of diagonal matrices of same order will be commutative. \n\nZero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices \n\nWe know that, for real numbers $a$ $^ { b }$ if $a b = 0$ ,then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ .This need not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example. Y \n\nExample 15 Find AB, if $\\mathrm { A } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { - 1 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } \\end{array} \\right] }$ and $\\mathbf { B } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 3 } & { 5 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ \n\nSolution We have $\\mathbf { A B } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { - 1 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } \\end{array} \\right] } { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 3 } & { 5 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } \\end{array} \\right] } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ \n\nThus, ifthe product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of the matrices is a zero matrix. \n\n3.4.6 Properties of multiplication of matrices \n\nThe multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without proof. \n\n1. The associative law For any three matrices A, B and C. We have (AB) $\\mathrm { C } = \\mathrm { A }$ (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined. \n\n2.

Since for any matrix A, $( k \\mathrm { A } ) ^ { \\prime } = k \\mathrm { A } ^ { \\prime }$ , it follows that $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } ( \\mathbf { A } + \\mathbf { A } ^ { \\prime } )$ \n\nis symmetric matrix and $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\left( \\mathbf { A } - \\mathbf { A } ^ { \\prime } \\right)$ is skew symmetric matrix.

STEINMETZ \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nIn the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices and algebra of matrices.We have also learnt that a system of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like \n\ncan be represented as ${ \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { a _ { 1 } } & { b _ { 1 } } \\\\ { a _ { 2 } } & { b _ { 2 } } \\end{array} \\right] } { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { x } \\\\ { y } \\end{array} \\right] } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { c _ { 1 } } \\\\ { c _ { 2 } } \\end{array} \\right] }$ Now,this system of equations has a unique solution or not, is determined by the number $a _ { _ 1 } \\ b _ { _ 2 } - a _ { _ 2 } b _ { _ 1 }$ (Recall that if $\\frac { a _ { 1 } } { a _ { 2 } } \\neq \\frac { b _ { 1 } } { b _ { 2 } }$ or $a _ { _ 1 } b _ { _ 2 } - a _ { _ 2 } b _ { _ 1 } \\neq 0$ ，then the system of linear equations has a unique solution). The number $a _ { _ 1 } b _ { _ 2 } - a _ { _ 2 } b _ { _ 1 }$ \n\nwhich determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathsf { A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { a _ { 1 } } & { b _ { 1 } } \\\\ { a _ { 2 } } & { b _ { 2 } } \\end{array} \\right] } \\end{array}$   \nand is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in   \nEngineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc. \n\nIn this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries. Also, we willstudy various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications of determinants in finding the area of a triangle,adjoint and inverse ofa square matrix, consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix. \n\n4.2 Determinant \n\nTo every square matrix $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ of order $n$ ，we can associate a number (real or complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where $a _ { _ { i j } } ^ { \\mathrm { } } = ( i , j ) ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ element of A. \n\nThis may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a unique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, $\\mathrm { K }$ is the set of numbers (real or complex) and $f$ $\\mathbf { \\partial } \\cdot \\mathbf { M } \\to \\mathbf { K }$ is defined by $f ( \\mathrm { A } ) = k ,$ where $\\mathbf A \\in \\mathbf M$ and $k \\in \\mathrm { K }$ ,then $f ( \\mathrm { A } )$ is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by $| \\mathrm { A } |$ or det A or $\\Delta$ \n\nRemarks \n\n(i)For matrix A, $| \\mathbf { A } |$ is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A.   \n(ii) Only square matrices have determinants. \n\n4.2.1 Determinant of a matrix of order one \n\nLet $\\mathrm { A } = \\left[ a \\right]$ be the matrix of order 1, then determinant of A is defined to be equal to $a$ \n\n4.2.2 Determinant of a matrix of order two \n\nLet \n\n$\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathrm { A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { a _ { 1 1 } } & { a _ { 1 2 } } \\\\ { a _ { 2 1 } } & { a _ { 2 2 } } \\end{array} \\right] } \\end{array}$ be a matrix of order $2 \\times 2$ \n\nthen the determinant of A is defined as: \n\nExample 1 Evaluate $\\left| \\begin{array} { c c } { { 2 } } & { { 4 } } \\\\ { { - 1 } } & { { 2 } } \\end{array} \\right| .$ \n\nX x+1 Example 2 Evaluate x-1 X \n\nSolution We have \n\n4.2.3 Determinant of a matrix of order $3 \\times 3$ \n\nDeterminant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of second order determinants. This is known as expansion of a determinant along a row (or a column). There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order \n\n3 corresponding to each of three rows $( \\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } , \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ ） and three columns $( \\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } )$ giving the same value as shown below. \n\nConsider the determinant of square matrix $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { 3 \\times 3 }$ \n\ni.e., \n\nExpansion along first Row $( \\mathbf { R } _ { 1 } )$ \n\nStep 1 Multiply first element $a _ { { } _ { 1 1 } }$ of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ by $( - 1 ) ^ { ( 1 + 1 ) }$ [(-1)sum f sufixes in $^ { a _ { 1 1 } } ]$ and with the second order determinant obtained by deleting the elements of first row $( \\mathbb { R } _ { 1 } )$ and first column $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 1 } ) }$ of $| \\mathrm { \\bf A } |$ as $a _ { { } _ { 1 1 } }$ lies in $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { 1 3 } }$ \n\ni.e., \n\nStep 2 Multiply 2nd element $a _ { 1 2 }$ of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ by $( - 1 ) ^ { 1 + 2 } \\left[ ( - 1 ) ^ { \\mathrm { s u m o f s u f f i x e s \\ i n } a } 1 2 \\right]$ and the second order determinant obtained by deleting elements offirst row $( \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } )$ and 2nd column $\\left( \\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\right)$ of $| \\mathrm { A } |$ as $a _ { _ { 1 2 } }$ lies in $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 ^ { \\flat } }$ 一 \n\ni.e., \n\nStep 3 Multiply third element $a _ { 1 3 }$ of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ by $( - 1 ) ^ { 1 + 3 } [ ( - 1 ) ^ { \\mathrm { s u m o f s u f f i x e s \\ i n } a _ { 1 3 } } ]$ and the second of order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row $| \\mathrm { A } |$ as $a _ { 1 3 }$ lies in $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } ,$ $( \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } )$ and third column $\\displaystyle ( \\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } )$ \n\ni.e., \n\nStep 4 Now the expansion of determinant of A, that is, $| \\mathbf { A } |$ written as sum of all three terms obtained in steps 1,2 and 3 above is given by \n\nor \n\nNoteWe shall apply allfour steps together. \n\nExpansion along second row $( \\mathbf { R } _ { 2 } )$ \n\nExpanding along $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } ^ { }$ we get \n\nExpansion along first Column $( \\mathbf { C _ { 1 } } )$ \n\nBy expanding along $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } ,$ we get \n\nClearly, values of $| \\mathbf { A } |$ in (1), (2) and (3) are equal.

The arrangement ofrods was precisely that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant Mikami, China, pp 30, 93. \n\nSeki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth century in his work ‘Kai Fukudai no Ho’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of determinants and of their expansion.But he used this device only in eliminating a quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution ofa set of simultaneous linear equations. T. Hayashi, “The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese Mathematics,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V. \n\nVendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions. He may be called the formal founder. Laplace (1772), gave general method of expanding a determinant in terms ofits complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his theory of numbers. \n\nThe next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and nrows, which for the special case of $m = n$ reduces to the multiplication theorem. \n\nAlso on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof ofmultiplication theorem more satisfactory than Binet's. \n\nThe greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after this the word determinant received its final acceptance.",

    "content": "CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY \n\n: The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.\" ALBERT EINSTEIN ： \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nThis chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and trigonometric functions.In this chapter, we introduce the very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and relations between them.We will also learn differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions.Further, we introduce a new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we will learn some fundamental theorems in this area. \n\n5.2 Continuity \n\nWe start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider the function \n\nThis function is of course defined at every point of the real line. Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the graph that the value of the function at nearby points on $x$ -axisremain close to each other except at $x = 0$ .At the points near and to the left of 0, i.e., at points li $\\mathrm { k e } - 0 . 1 , - 0 . 0 1 , - 0 . 0 0 1$ ， the value of the function is 1.At the points near and to the right of O,i.e., at points like O.1, 0.01, \n\n0.001,the value of the function is 2.Using the language of left and right hand limits, we may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of $f$ at O is 1 (respectively 2). In particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide.We also observe that the value of the function at $x = 0$ concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke,i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when we come to O from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nNow, consider the function defined as \n\nThis function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at $x = 0$ are both equal to 1.But the value of the function at $x = 0$ equals 2 which does not coincide with the common value of the left and right hand limits. Again, we note that we cannot draw the graph of the function without lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of a function being not continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nNaively, we may say that a function is continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the graph of the function around that point without lifting the pen from the plane of the paper. \n\nMathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows: \n\nDefinition 1 Suppose fis a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let $c$ be a point in the domain of f. Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if \n\nMore elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function at $x = c$ exist and equal to each other, thenfis said to be continuous at $x = c .$ Recall that if the right hand and left hand limits at $x = c$ coincide, then we say that the common value is the limit of the function at $x = c .$ .Hence we may also rephrase the definition of continuity as follows: a function is continuous at $x = c$ if the function is defined at $x = c$ and if the value of the function at $x = c$ equals the limit of the function at $x = c$ If $f$ is not continuous at $c$ we say $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ and $c$ is called a point of discontinuity of $f .$ \n\nExample 1 Check the continuity of the function $f$ given by $f ( x ) = 2 x + 3$ at $x = 1$ Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point $x = 1$ and its value is 5. Then find the limit of the function at $x = 1$ . Clearly \n\nThus \n\nHence, $f$ is continuous at $x = 1$ \n\nExample 2 Examine whether the function $f$ given by $f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 }$ is continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nSolution First note that the function is defined at the given point $x = 0$ and its value is 0. Then find the limit of the function at $x = 0$ . Clearly \n\nThus \n\nHence, $f$ is continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nExample 3 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by $f ( x ) = \\mid x \\mid$ at $x = 0$ \n\nSolution By definition \n\nClearly the function is defined at O and. $f ( 0 ) = 0$ Left hand limit of $f$ at 0 is \n\nSimilarly, the right hand limit offat O is \n\nThus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at $x = 0$ Hence, $f$ is continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nExample 4 Show that the function $f$ given by \n\nis not continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nSolution The function is defined at $x = 0$ and its value at $x = 0$ is 1. When $x \\neq 0$ the function is given by a polynomial. Hence, \n\nSince the limit offat $x = 0$ does not coincide with $f ( 0 )$ ,the function is not continuous at $x = 0$ . It may be noted that $x = 0$ is the only point of discontinuity for this function. \n\nExample 5 Check the points where the constant function $f ( x ) = k$ is continuous. \n\nSolution The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition,its value at any real number equals $k .$ Let $c$ be any real number. Then \n\nSince $f ( c ) = k = \\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x )$ for any real number $c$ , the function $f$ is continuous at every real number. 1 \n\nExample 6 Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by $f ( x ) = x$ is continuous at every real number. \n\nSolution The function is clearly defined at every point and $f ( c ) = c$ for every real number $c$ Also, \n\nThus, $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = c = f ( c )$ and hence the function is continuous at every real number. \n\nHaving defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function. \n\nDefinition 2 A real functionfis said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point in the domain of f. \n\nThis definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose $f$ is a function defined on a closed interval $[ a , b ]$ ,then for $f$ to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every point in $[ a , b ]$ including the end points $a$ and $^ { b }$ . Continuity offat $a$ means \n\nand continuity of $f$ at $^ { b }$ means \n\nObserve that $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to a ^ { - } } f ( x )$ and $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to b ^ { + } } f ( x )$ do not make sense. As a consequence of this definition, iff is defined only at one point, it is continuous there, i.e.,if the domain of $\\cdot _ { f }$ is a singleton, $f$ is a continuous function. \n\nExample 7 Is the function defined by $f ( x ) = | { x } | ,$ a continuous function? \n\nSolution We may rewrite $f$ as \n\nBy Example 3, we know that $f$ is continuous at $x = 0$ \n\nLet $c$ be a real number such that $c < 0$ .Then $f ( c ) = - c$ Also \n\nSince $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = f ( c ) , f$ is continuous at all negative real numbers. \n\nNow, let $c$ be a real number such that $c > 0$ Then $f ( c ) = c$ Also \n\nSince $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = f ( c ) , f$ is continuous at all positive real numbers. Hence, $f$ is continuous at all points. \n\nExample 8 Discuss the continuity of the function fgiven by $f ( x ) = x ^ { 3 } + x ^ { 2 } - 1$ \n\nSolution Clearly fis defined at every real number $c$ and its value at $c$ is $c ^ { 3 } + c ^ { 2 } - 1$ .We also know that \n\nThus $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = f ( c )$ ,and hencefis continuous at every real number.This means $f$ is a continuous function. \n\nExample 9 Discuss the continuity of the function $f$ defined ${ \\mathrm { b y } } f ( x ) = { \\frac { 1 } { x } } , x \\neq 0 .$ \n\nSolution Fix any non zero real number $c$ ,we have \n\nAlso,since for $c \\neq 0 .$ $f ( c ) = { \\frac { 1 } { c } }$ ,we have lim f(x)= f(c) and hence $f$ is continuous at every point in the domain of $f .$ Thus $f$ is a continuous function. \n\nWe take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity. This we do by analysing the function $f ( x ) = { \\frac { 1 } { x } }$ near $x = 0$ . To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to find the right hand limit offat 0.We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1). \n\nWe observe that as $x$ gets closer to O from the right, the value of $f ( x )$ shoots up higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of $f ( x )$ may be made larger than any given number by choosing a positive real number very close to O. In symbols, we write \n\n(to be read as: the right hand limit of $f ( x )$ at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise that $+ \\infty$ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit offat O does not exist (as a real number). \n\nSimilarly, the left hand limit of $f$ at O may be found. The following table is self explanatory. \n\nFrom the Table 5.2, we deduce that the value of $f ( x )$ may be made smaller than any given number by choosing a negative real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write \n\n(to be read as: the left hand limit of $f ( x )$ at O is minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise that $- \\infty$ is NOT a real number and hence the left hand limit offat O does not exist (as a real number). The graph of the reciprocal function given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation of the above mentioned facts. \n\nExample 10 Discuss the continuity of the function fdefined by \n\nSolution The function $f$ is defined at all points of the real line. \n\nCase 1 If $c < 1$ ，then $f ( c ) = c + 2$ .Therefore, $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = \\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } ( x + 2 ) = c + 2$ Thus, $f$ is continuous at all real numbers less than 1. \n\nCase 2 If $c > 1$ ,then $f ( c ) = c - 2$ Therefore, \n\nThus, $f$ is continuous at all points $x > 1$ \n\nCase 3 If $c = 1$ , then the left hand limit of $f$ at $x = 1$ is 1 \n\nThe right hand limit of $f$ at $x = 1$ is \n\nSince the left and right hand limits of fat $x = 1$ do not coincide, $f$ is not continuous at $x = 1$ .Hence \n\n$x = 1$ is the only point of discontinuity off. The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4. \n\nExample 11 Find all the points of discontinuity of the function fdefined by \n\nSolution As in the previous example we find thatf is continuous at all real numbers $x \\neq 1$ . The left hand limit offat $x = 1$ is \n\nThe right hand limit offat $x = 1$ is \n\nSince, the left and right hand limits offat $x = 1$ do not coincide, $f$ is not continuous at $x = 1$ . Hence $x = 1$ is the only point of discontinuity of $f .$ The graph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5. \n\nExample 12 Discuss the continuity of the function defined by \n\nSolution Observe that the function is defined at all real numbers except at O. Domain of definition of this function is \n\n$\\mathrm { D } _ { 1 } \\cup \\mathrm { D } _ { 2 }$ where $\\mathbf { D } _ { 1 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { R } : x < 0 \\}$ and $\\mathrm { D } _ { 2 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { R } : x > 0 \\}$ \n\nCase 1 If $c \\in \\mathrm { D } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } ,$ then $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x  c } f ( x ) = \\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x  c } \\ ( x + 2 )$ $= c + 2 = f ( c )$ and hence $f$ is continuous in $\\mathrm { D } _ { 1 }$ \n\nCase 2 If $c \\in \\mathrm { D } _ { 2 }$ then $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = \\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } \\ ( - x + 2 )$ $= - c + 2 = f ( c )$ and hence $f$ is continuous in $\\mathrm { D } _ { 2 }$ Sincefis continuous at all points in the domain off, we deduce that $f$ is continuous. Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.6. Note that to graph this function we need to lift the pen from the plane of the paper, but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not defined. \n\nExample 13 Discuss the continuity of the function fgiven by \n\nSolution Clearly the function is defined at every real number. Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.7.By inspection, it seems prudent to partition the domain of definition of $f$ into three disjoint subsets of the real line. \n\nLet $\\begin{array} { l l } { \\mathbf { D } _ { 1 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { R } : x < 0 \\} _ { } } \\\\ { \\mathbf { D } _ { 3 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { R } : x > 0 \\} } \\end{array}$ $\\mathrm { D } _ { 2 } = \\{ 0 \\}$ and \n\nCase 1 At any point in $\\mathrm { D } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ we have $f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 }$ and it is easy to see that it is continuous there (see Example 2). \n\nCase 2 At any point in $\\mathrm { D } _ { 3 }$ ,we have $f ( x ) = x$ and it is easy to see that it is continuous there (see Example 6). \n\nCase 3 Now we analyse the function at $x = 0$ . The value of the function at O is $f ( 0 ) = 0$ The left hand limit of $f$ at 0is \n\nThe right hand limit offat O is \n\nThus $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to 0 } f ( x ) = 0 = f ( 0 )$ and hence $f$ is continuous at O. This means that $f$ is continuous at every point in its domain and hence, $f$ is a continuous function. 一 \n\nExample 14 Show that every polynomial function is continuous. \n\nSolution Recall that a function $p$ is a polynomial function if it is defined by $p ( x ) = a _ { _ 0 } + a _ { _ 1 } x + \\ldots + a _ { _ n } x ^ { n }$ for some natural number $n$ ， $a _ { _ n } \\neq 0$ and $a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle i } \\in \\mathbf { R }$ Clearly this function is defined for every real number. For a fixed real number $c$ ,we have \n\nBy definition, $p$ is continuous at $c$ . Since $c$ is any real number, $p$ is continuous at every real number and hence $p$ is a continuous function. \n\nExample 15 Find allthe points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined by $f ( x ) = [ x ]$ ,where $[ x ]$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ \n\nSolution First observe that $f$ is defined for all real numbers. Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.8. From the graph it looks like that f is discontinuous at every integral point. Below we explore, if this is true. \n\nCase 1 Let $c$ be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the graph that for all real numbers close to $c$ the value of the function is equal to $[ c ]$ ;i.e., $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = \\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } \\left[ x \\right] = \\left[ c \\right] . { \\mathrm { A l s o } } f ( c ) = \\left[ c \\right]$ and hence the function is continuous at all real numbers not equal to integers. \n\nCase 2 Let $c$ be an integer. Then we can find a sufficiently small real number $r > 0$ such that $[ c - r ] = c - 1$ whereas $[ c + r ] = c$ \n\nThis, in terms of limits mean that \n\nSince these limits cannot be equal to each other for any $c$ ，the function is discontinuous at every integral point. \n\n5.2.1 Algebra of continuous functions \n\nIn the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions. Since continuity ofa function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits. \n\nTheorem 1 Suppose $f$ and $g$ be two real functions continuous at a real number $c$ Then \n\n(1) (2) $f + g$ $f - g$ is continuous at is continuous at $x = c$ $x = c$ re (3) $f . g$ is continuous at $x = c$ (4) $\\left[ { \\frac { f } { g } } \\right)$ is continuous at $x = c _ { i }$ , (provided $g ( c ) \\neq 0$ \n\nProof We are investigating continuity of $( f + g )$ at $x = c$ .Clearly it is defined at $x = c$ We have \n\nHence, $f + g$ is continuous at $x = c$ \n\nProofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader. \n\nRemarks \n\n(i)As a special case of(3) above, if $f$ is a constant function, i.e., $f ( x ) = \\lambda$ for some real number $\\lambda$ , then the function $( \\lambda . g )$ defined by $( \\lambda . g ) ( x ) = \\lambda . g ( x )$ is also continuous. In particular if $\\lambda = - 1$ , the continuity offimplies continuity of $- f .$   \n(ii) As a special case of (4) above, if $f$ is the constant function $f ( x ) = \\lambda$ ,then the function $\\frac { \\lambda } { g }$ defined by $\\frac { \\lambda } { g } ( x ) = \\frac { \\lambda } { g ( x ) }$ is also continuous wherever $g ( x ) \\neq 0$ In particular, the continuity of $g$ implies continuity of $\\frac { 1 } { g }$ 一 \n\nThe above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples illustrate this: \n\nExample 16 Prove that every rational function is continuous. \n\nSolution Recall that every rational function $f$ is given by \n\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are polynomial functions. The domain of $f$ is all real numbers except points at which $q$ is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14),fis continuous by (4) of Theorem 1. \n\nExample 17 Discuss the continuity of sine function. \n\nSolution To see this we use the following facts \n\nWe have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin $x$ near 0. \n\nNow, observe that $f ( x ) = \\sin { x }$ is defined for every real number. Let $c$ be a real number. Put $x = c + h$ If $x \\to c$ we know that $h  0$ .Therefore \n\nThus $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { x \\to c } f ( x ) = f ( c )$ and hence $f$ is a continuous function. \n\nRemark A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function. \n\nExample 18 Prove that the function defined by $f ( x ) = \\tan x$ is a continuous function. \n\nthat cos $x \\neq 0$ i.e., $x \\neq { \\bigl ( } 2 n + 1 { \\bigr ) } \\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ We have just proved that both sine and cosine functions are continuous. Thus tan $x$ being a quotient of two continuous functions is continuous wherever it is defined. 7 \n\nAn interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to composition of functions. Recall that if fand $g$ are two real functions, then \n\nis defined whenever the range of $_ g$ is a subset of domain off. The following theorem (stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions. \n\nTheorem 2 Suppose $f$ and $_ g$ are real valued functions such that $( f _ { 0 } g )$ is defined at $c$ If $g$ is continuous at $c$ and if $f$ is continuous at $g ( c )$ ,then $( f _ { 0 } g )$ is continuous at $c$ \n\nThe following examples illustrate this theorem. \n\nExample 19 Show that the function defined by $f ( x ) = \\sin \\left( x ^ { 2 } \\right)$ is a continuous function. \n\nSolution Observe that the function is defined for every real number. The function $f$ may be thought of as a composition $g \\circ h$ of the two functions $_ g$ and $h$ ，where $g ( x ) = \\sin x$ and $h \\left( x \\right) = x ^ { 2 }$ . Since both $_ g$ and $h$ are continuous functions, by Theorem 2, it can be deduced that fis a continuous function. \n\nExample 20 Show that the function fdefined by \n\nwhere $x$ is any real number, is a continuous function. \n\nSolution Define $g$ by $g ( x ) = 1 - x + | x |$ and $h$ by $h \\left( x \\right) = \\left| x \\right|$ for all real $x$ Then \n\nIn Example 7, we have seen that $h$ is a continuous function. Hence $_ g$ being a sum of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then $f$ being a composite of two continuous functions is continuous. \n\nEXERCISE 5.1 \n\n1． Prove that the function $f ( x ) = 5 x - 3$ is continuous at $x = 0$ at $x = - 3$ and at $x = 5$ \n\n2．Examine the continuity of the function $f ( x ) = 2 x ^ { 2 } - 1$ at $x = 3$ \n\n3．Examine the following functions for continuity. \n\n(a) $f ( x ) = x - 5 \\qquad \\quad ( { \\mathrm { b } } ) \\ : \\ : f ( x ) = { \\frac { 1 } { x - 5 } } , x \\neq 5$ （c） $f ( x ) = { \\frac { x ^ { 2 } - 2 5 } { x + 5 } } , x \\neq - 5 \\qquad { \\mathrm { ( d ) } } \\ f ( x ) = | x - 5 |$ \n\n4． Prove that the function $f ( x ) = x ^ { n }$ is continuous at $x = n$ ，where $n$ is a positive integer. \n\n5．Is the functionfdefined by \n\ncontinuous at $x = 0 ?$ At $x = 1 2$ At $x = 2 ?$ \n\nFind all points of discontinuity off, where fis defined by \n\n10. $f ( x ) = { \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { x + 1 , { \\mathrm { ~ i f ~ } } x \\geq 1 } \\\\ { x ^ { 2 } + 1 , { \\mathrm { i f ~ } } x < 1 } \\end{array} \\right. }$ \n\n11. $f ( x ) = { \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { x ^ { 3 } - 3 , } & { { \\mathrm { i f ~ } } x \\leq 2 } \\\\ { x ^ { 2 } + 1 , } & { { \\mathrm { i f ~ } } x > 2 } \\end{array} \\right. }$ \n\n12. $f ( x ) = { \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { x ^ { 1 0 } - 1 , } & { { \\mathrm { i f ~ } } x \\leq 1 } \\\\ { x ^ { 2 } , } & { { \\mathrm { i f ~ } } x > 1 } \\end{array} \\right. }$ \n\n13．Is the function defined by \n\na continuous function? \n\nDiscuss the continuity ofthe function $f ,$ where $f$ is defined by \n\n16. $\\scriptstyle f ( x ) = { \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { - 2 , { \\mathrm { ~ i f ~ } } x \\leq - 1 } \\\\ { 2 x , { \\mathrm { ~ i f ~ } } - 1 < x \\leq 1 } \\\\ { 2 , { \\mathrm { ~ i f ~ } } x > 1 } \\end{array} \\right. }$ \n\n17．Find the relationship between $a$ and $^ { b }$ so that the function fdefined by \n\nis continuous at $x = 3$ \n\n18． For what value of $\\lambda$ is the function defined by \n\ncontinuous at $x = 0 2$ What about continuity at $x = 1 2$ \n\n19.

Differentiability \n\nRecall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real function as follows: \n\nSuppose f is a real function and $c$ is a point in its domain. The derivative offat $c$ is defined by \n\nprovided this limit exists.Derivative of $f$ at $c$ is denoted by $f ^ { \\prime } ( c )$ or ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } ( f ( x ) ) | _ { c } .$ The function defined by \n\nwherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of $f .$ The derivative of $f$ is denoted by $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ or ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } ( f ( x ) )$ or if $y = f ( x )$ by ${ \\frac { d y } { d x } } \\mathrm { o r } \\ y ^ { \\prime }$ The processf finding derivative of a function is called differentiation. We also use the phrase differentiate $f ( x )$ with respect to $x$ to mean find $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ \n\nThe following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives: \n\n(1) $( u \\pm \\nu ) ^ { \\prime } = u ^ { \\prime } \\pm \\nu ^ { \\prime }$ (2） $( u \\nu ) ^ { \\prime } = u ^ { \\prime } \\nu + u \\nu ^ { \\prime }$ (Leibnitz or product rule) \n\n(3) $\\left( \\frac { u } { \\nu } \\right) ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { u ^ { \\prime } \\nu - u \\nu ^ { \\prime } } { \\nu ^ { 2 } } ;$ wherever $\\nu \\neq 0$ (Quotient rule). \n\nThe following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions: \n\nWhenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists. Now the natural question is; what if it doesn't? The question is quite pertinent and so is its answer. If $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { h \\to 0 } { \\frac { f ( c + h ) - f ( c ) } { h } }$ does not exist we ay hat $f$ is ot diffretale at $c$ In other words, we say that a functionfis differentiable at a point $c$ in its domain if both $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { h \\to 0 ^ { - } } { \\frac { f ( c + h ) - f ( c ) } { h } }$ and $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { h \\to 0 ^ { + } } { \\frac { f ( c + h ) - f ( c ) } { h } }$ are finite and equal. A function is said to be differentiable in an interval $[ a , b ]$ if it is differentiable at every point of $[ a , b ]$ .As in case of continuity,at the end points $a$ and $^ { b }$ ,we take the right hand limit and left hand limit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function at $a$ and $^ { b }$ respectively. Similarly, a function is said to be differentiable in an interval $( a , b )$ if it is differentiable at every point of $( a , b )$ \n\nTheorem 3 If a functionfis differentiable at a point $c$ ,then it is also continuous at that point. \n\nProof Since $f$ is differentiable at $c$ ,we have \n\nBut for $x \\neq c$ ,we have \n\nTherefore \n\nor \n\nor \n\nHence $f$ is continuous at $x = c$ \n\nCorollary 1 Every differentiable function is continuous. \n\nWe remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have seen that the function defined b $\\ y f ( x ) = | x |$ is a continuous function. Consider the left hand limit \n\nThe right hand limit \n\nSince the above left and right hand limits at O are not equal, $\\operatorname* { l i m } _ { h \\to 0 } { \\frac { f ( 0 + h ) - f ( 0 ) } { h } }$ does not exist and hence $f$ is not differentiable at O. Thus $f$ is not a differentiable function. \n\n5.3.1 Derivatives of composite functions \n\nTo study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say, we want to find the derivative of $f ,$ where \n\nOne way is to expand $( 2 x + 1 ) ^ { 3 }$ using binomial theorem and find the derivative as a polynomial function as illustrated below. \n\nNow, observe that \n\nwhere $g ( x ) = 2 x + 1$ and $h ( x ) = x ^ { 3 }$ .Put $t = g ( x ) = 2 x + 1$ Then $f ( x ) = h ( t ) = t ^ { 3 }$ Thus \n\nThe advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding the derivative of, say, $( 2 x + 1 ) ^ { 1 0 0 }$ . We may formalise this observation in the following theorem called the chain rule. \n\nTheorem 4 (Chain Rule) Let fbe a real valued function which is a composite of two functions $u$ and $\\nu ; \\mathrm { i } . \\mathrm { e } . , f { = } \\nu$ 0 $u$ Suppose $t = u ( x )$ and if both $\\frac { d t } { d x }$ and $\\frac { d \\nu } { d t }$ exist, we have \n\nWe skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose $f$ is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions $u , \\nu$ and $w$ ;i.e., \n\n$f = ( w \\mathrm { ~ o ~ } u )$ 0 $\\nu .$ If $t = \\nu \\left( x \\right)$ and $s = u \\left( t \\right)$ ,then\n\nprovided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain rule for composite of more functions. \n\nExample 21 Find the derivative of the function given by $f ( x ) = \\sin \\left( x ^ { 2 } \\right)$ \n\nSolution Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions.Indeed, if $t = u ( x ) = x ^ { 2 }$ and $\\nu ( t ) = \\sin t .$ then \n\nPut $t = u ( x ) = x ^ { 2 }$ .

For example, consider one of the following relationships between $x$ and $y$ \n\nIn the first case, we can solve for $y$ and rewrite the relationship as $y = x - \\pi$ In the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve fory.Nevertheless, there is no doubt about the dependence of $y$ on $x$ in either of the cases. When a relationship between $x$ and $y$ is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for $y$ and write $y = f ( x )$ ,we say that $y$ is given as an explicit function of $x$ In the latter case it is implicit that $y$ is a function of $x$ and we say that the relationship of the second type, above, gives function implicitly.In this subsection, we learn to differentiate implicit functions. \n\nExample 22 ind $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ if x-y=π. \n\nSolution One way is to solve for $y$ and rewrite the above as \n\nBut then \n\nAlternatively,directly differentiating the relationship w.t., $x ,$ we have \n\nRecall that $\\frac { d \\pi } { d x }$ means to differentiate the constant function taking value $\\pi$ everywhere w.r.t., $x$ Thus \n\nwhich implies that \n\nExample 23 Find $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ ,ify + siny= cos x. \n\nSolution We diferentiate the relationship directly with respect to $x _ { i }$ i.e., \n\nwhich implies using chain rule \n\nThis gives \n\nwhere \n\n5.3.3 Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions \n\nWe remark that inverse trigonometric functions are continuous functions, but we will not prove this. Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions. \n\nExample 24 Find the derivative off given by $f ( x ) = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ assuming it exists. \n\nSolution Let $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x $ Then, $x = \\sin y$ \n\nDifferentiating both sides w.r.t. $x _ { i }$ we get \n\nwhich implies that \n\nObserve that this is defined only for cos $y \\neq 0$ i.e., $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x \\neq - \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ i.e., $x \\neq - 1 , 1$ i.e., $x \\in ( - 1 , 1 )$ R \n\nTo make this result a bit more attractive, we carry out the following manipulation. Recall that for $x \\in ( - 1 , 1 )$ ,sin $( \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ) = x$ and hence \n\nAlso,since $y \\in \\left( - { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\cos y$ $y = { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } }$ Thus, for $x \\in ( - 1 , 1 )$ ，\n\nEXERCISE 5.3 \n\nFind $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ in the following: \n\n7. $\\sin ^ { 2 } y + \\cos x y = \\kappa \\quad 8 . \\sin ^ { 2 } x + \\cos ^ { 2 } y = 1 \\quad 9 . \\ y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } \\left( { \\frac { 2 x } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } } \\right)$ \n\n15.y=sec\\*(-0<x< \n\n5.4 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions \n\nTill now we have learnt some aspects of different classes of functions like polynomial functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions. In this section, we shall learn about a new class of(related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic functions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are motivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text. \n\nThe Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of $\\scriptstyle y = f _ { 1 } ( x ) = x , y = f _ { 2 } ( x ) = x ^ { 2 } , y = f _ { 3 } ( x ) = x ^ { 3 }$ and $\\scriptstyle y = f _ { 4 } ( x )$ $= x ^ { 4 }$ . Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of $x$ increases. Steeper the curve, faster is the rate of growth.What this means is that for a fixed increment in the value of $x ( > 1 )$ , the increment in the value of $y = f _ { n } ( x )$ increases as $n$ increases for $n$ $= 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .$ It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of $n$ \n\nwhere $f _ { n } ( x ) = x ^ { n }$ Essentially, this means that the graph of $y = f _ { n } \\left( x \\right)$ leans more towards the $y$ -axis as $n$ increases.For example, consider $f _ { 1 0 } ( x ) = x ^ { 1 0 }$ and $f _ { 1 5 } ( x )$ $= x ^ { 1 5 }$ If $x$ increases from 1 to 2, $f _ { 1 0 }$ increases from 1 to $2 ^ { 1 0 }$ whereas $f _ { 1 5 }$ increases from 1 to $2 ^ { 1 5 }$ .Thus,for the same increment in $x , f _ { 1 5 }$ grow faster than $f _ { 1 0 }$ \n\nUpshot of the above discussion is that the growth of polynomial functions is dependent on the degree of the polynomial function - higher the degree,greater is the growth. The next natural question is: \n\nIs there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in affirmative and an example of such a function is \n\nOur claim is that this functionfgrows faster than $f _ { n } ( x ) = x ^ { n }$ for any positive integer $n$ For example, we can prove that $1 0 ^ { x }$ grows faster than $f _ { 1 0 0 } ( x ) = x ^ { 1 0 0 }$ For large values of $x$ like $x = 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ ,note that $f _ { _ { 1 0 0 } } \\left( x \\right) = ( 1 0 ^ { 3 } ) ^ { 1 0 0 } = 1 0 ^ { 3 0 0 }$ whereas $f ( 1 0 ^ { 3 } ) = 1 0 ^ { 1 0 ^ { 3 } } = 1 0 ^ { 1 0 0 0 }$ Clearly $f ( x )$ is much greater than $f _ { _ { 1 0 0 } } ( x )$ .It is not difficult to prove that for all $x > 1 0 ^ { 3 } , f ( x ) > f _ { 1 0 0 } \\left( x \\right)$ But we will not attempt to give a proof ofthis here. Similarly, by choosing large values of $x$ 。one can verify that $f ( x )$ grows faster than $f _ { n } \\left( x \\right)$ for any positive integer $n$ \n\nDefinition 3 The exponential function with positive base $b > 1$ is the function \n\nThe graph of $y = 1 0 ^ { x }$ is given in the Fig 5.9. \n\nIt is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of $^ { b }$ like 2, 3 and 4. Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions: \n\n(1) Domain of the exponential function is $\\mathbf { R }$ , the set of all real numbers.   \n(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.   \n(3) The point (O,1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a restatement of the fact that $b ^ { 0 } = 1$ for any real $b > 1$ ).   \n(4)Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e.,as we move from left to right, the graph rises above. \n\n(5） For very large negative values of $x _ { i }$ , the exponential function is very close to 0. In other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches $x$ -axis (but never meets it). \n\nExponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function. In the Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series \n\nis a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by $e$ Using this $e$ as the base we obtain an extremely important exponential function $y = e ^ { x }$ 一 \n\nThis is called natural exponential function. \n\nIt would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and has nice interpretation. This search motivates the following definition. \n\nDefinition 4 Let $b > 1$ be a real number. Then we say logarithm of $a$ to base $^ { b }$ is $x$ if $b ^ { x } = a$ \n\nLogarithm of $a$ to base $^ { b }$ is denoted by $\\log _ { b } a$ Thus $\\log _ { b } a = x$ if $b ^ { x } = a$ Let us work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know $2 ^ { 3 } = 8$ . In terms of logarithms, we may rewrite this as $\\log _ { 2 } 8 = 3 .$ Similarly, $1 0 ^ { 4 } = 1 0 0 0 0$ is equivalent to saying $\\mathrm { l o g } _ { 1 0 }$ $1 0 0 0 0 = 4$ Also, $6 2 5 = 5 ^ { \\bar { 4 } } = 2 5 ^ { 2 }$ is equivalent to saying $\\log _ { 5 } 6 2 5 = 4$ or $\\log _ { 2 5 } 6 2 5 = 2$ \n\nOn a slightly more mature note, fixing a base $b > 1$ ,we may look at logarithm as a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers.This function, called the logarithmic function, is defined by \n\nAs before if the base $b = 1 0$ , we say it is common logarithms and if $b = e$ then we say it is natural logarithms. Often natural logarithm is denoted by ln.In this chapter, log $x$ denotes the logarithm function to base $e$ ,i.e., ln $x$ will be written as simply $\\log x .$ . The Fig 5.10 gives the plots of logarithm function to base 2, $e$ and 10. \n\nSome of the important observations about the logarithm function to any base $b > 1$ are listed below: \n\n(1）We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers and hence the domain of log function is $\\mathbf { R } ^ { + }$ \n\n(2） The range of log function is the set of all real numbers. \n\n(3）The point $( 1 , 0 )$ is always on the graph of the log function. \n\n(4）The log function is ever increasing, i.e., as we move from left to right the graph rises above. \n\n(5）For $x$ very near to zero, the value of log $x$ can be made lesser than any given real number. In other words in the fourth quadrant the graph approaches $y$ -axis (but never meets it). \n\n(6)Fig 5.11 gives the plot of $y = e ^ { x }$ and $y = l n x$ .It is of interest to observe that the two curves are the mirror images of each other reflected in the line $y = x$ \n\nTwo properties of ‘log' functions are proved below: \n\n(1） There is a standard change of base rule to obtain $\\log _ { a } p$ in terms of $\\log _ { b } p$ Let $\\log _ { a } p = \\alpha$ $\\log _ { b } p = \\beta$ and $\\log _ { b } a = \\gamma$ This means $a ^ { \\mathrm { a } } = p$ $b ^ { \\beta } = p$ and $b ^ { \\gamma } = a$ Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have \n\nUsing this in the second equation, we get \n\nwhich implies X $\\beta = \\alpha \\gamma$ or $\\alpha = \\frac { \\beta } { \\gamma }$ But then \n\n(2） Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products.Let $\\log _ { b } p q = \\alpha$ . Then $b ^ { \\alpha } = p q$ If $\\log _ { b } p = \\beta$ and $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { l o g } } _ { b } \\ : q = \\boldsymbol { \\gamma }$ ,then $b ^ { \\beta } = p$ and $b ^ { \\gamma } = q$ But then $b ^ { \\alpha } = p q = b ^ { \\beta } b ^ { \\gamma } = b ^ { \\beta + \\gamma }$ \n\nwhich implies $\\alpha = \\beta + \\gamma ,$ i.e., \n\nA particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when $p = q$ In this case the above may be rewritten as \n\nAn easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is \n\nfor any positive integer $n$ . In fact this is true for any real number $n$ ,but we will not attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify \n\nExample 25 Is it true that $x = e ^ { \\log x }$ for all real $x ?$ \n\nSolution First, observe that the domain oflog function is set ofall positive real numbers. So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now, let $y = e ^ { \\log x }$ If $y > 0$ , we may take logarithm which gives us $\\log y = \\log \\left( e ^ { \\log x } \\right) = \\log x . \\log e = \\log x .$ Thus $y = x$ Hence $x = e ^ { \\log x }$ is true only for positive values of $x$ \n\nOne of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential calculus is that it doesn't change during the process of differentiation. This is captured in the following theorem whose proof we skip. \n\nTheorem 5\\* \n\n(1） The derivative of $e ^ { x }$ w.r.t., $x$ is $e ^ { x }$ i.e., ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } ( e ^ { x } ) = e ^ { x } .$ (2)The derivative oflog $x$ w.rt $x$ is ${ \\frac { 1 } { x } } ;$ i.c., ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } ( \\log x ) = { \\frac { 1 } { x } } .$ \n\nExample 26 Differentiate the following w.t. $x$ \n\ni $e ^ { - x }$ $\\mathrm { ( i i ) } \\quad \\sin ( \\log x ) , x > 0 \\qquad \\mathrm { ( i i i ) } \\quad \\cos ^ { - 1 } ( e ^ { x } )$ (iv）ecos x\n\nSolution \n\n(i) Let $y = e ^ { - x }$ .

More precisely,a relation expressed between two variables $x$ and $y$ in the form $x = f ( t ) , y = g ( t )$ is said to be parametric form with $t$ as a parameter. \n\nIn order to find derivative of function in such form, we have by chain rule. \n\nor \n\nThus \n\nExample 31 Find $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ if $x = a$ cos 0 $, y = a$ sin 0. \n\nSolution Given that \n\nTherefore \n\nHence \n\nExample 32 Find ${ \\frac { d y } { d x } } ,$ if $x = a t ^ { 2 } , y = 2 a t .$ \n\nSolution Given that $x = a t ^ { 2 }$ 。 $y = 2 a t$ \n\nSo \n\nTherefore \n\nExample 33 Find $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ ,if $x = a ( \\theta + \\sin \\theta ) , y = a ( 1 - \\cos \\theta ) .$ \n\nSolution We have $\\frac { d x } { d \\Theta } = a ( 1 + \\cos \\Theta ) , \\frac { d y } { d \\Theta } = a ( \\sin \\Theta )$ \n\nTherefore \n\nNoteIt may be noted here that $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ is expressed in terms of parameter only without directly involving the main variables $x$ and $y$ \n\nExample 34Find $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ $x ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } + y ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } = a ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } }$ \n\nSolution Let $x = a \\cos ^ { 3 } \\theta , y = a \\sin ^ { 3 } \\theta .$ Then \n\n$x = a \\cos ^ { 3 } \\theta , y = a \\sin ^ { 3 } \\theta$ $x ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } + y ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } = a ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } }$ \n\nNow \n\nTherefore \n\nEXERCISE 5.6 \n\nIf $x$ and $y$ are connected parametrically by the equations given in Exercises 1 to 10, withouteliminating theparameter,Find \n\n5. $x = \\cos \\theta - \\cos 2 \\theta , y = \\sin \\theta - \\sin 2 \\theta$ 6. $x = a \\ ( \\Theta - \\sin \\Theta ) , y = a \\ ( 1 + \\cos \\Theta ) \\quad 7 . \\quad x = { \\frac { \\sin ^ { 3 } t } { \\sqrt { \\cos 2 t } } } , \\ y = { \\frac { \\cos ^ { 3 } t } { \\sqrt { \\cos 2 t } } }$ 8. $x = a \\bigg ( \\cos t + \\log \\tan \\frac { t } { 2 } \\bigg ) y = a \\sin t \\quad 9 . \\quad x = a \\sec \\theta , y = b \\tan$ 0 10. $x = a ( \\cos \\theta + \\theta \\sin \\theta ) , y = a$ (sin 0 -0 cos 0) ublr 11.

In this chapter, we willstudy applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in engineering, science, social science,and many other fields.For instance, we will learn how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities,(ii) to find the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (ii) to find turning points on the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or smallest value (locally) of a function occurs.We will also use derivative to find intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.Finally, we use the derivative to find approximate value of certain quantities. \n\n6.2 Rate of Change of Quantities \n\nRecall that by the derivative $\\frac { d s } { d t }$ we mean the rate of change of distance $s$ with respect to the time t. In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity $y$ varies with another quantity $x ,$ ，satisfying some rule $y = f ( x )$ ,then $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ (or $f ( x ) )$ reprets he rte f change of $y$ with respect to $x$ and ${ \\frac { d y } { d x } } \\int _ { x = x _ { 0 } } \\left( \\operatorname { o r } f ^ { \\prime } ( x _ { _ 0 } ) \\right)$ represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ at $x = x _ { 0 }$ \n\nFurther, if two variables $x$ and $y$ are varying with respect to another variable $t _ { : }$ i.e., if $x = f ( t )$ and $y = g ( t )$ , then by Chain Rule \n\nThus, the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ can be calculated using the rate of change of $y$ and that of $x$ both with respect to $t$ \n\nLet us consider some examples. \n\nExample 1 Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to its radius $r$ when $r = 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ \n\nSolution The area A of a circle with radius $r$ is given by $\\mathrm { A } = \\pi r ^ { 2 }$ .Therefore, the rate ofcai $r$ is give by $\\frac { d \\mathrm { \\bf A } } { d r } = \\frac { d } { d r } ( \\pi r ^ { 2 } ) = 2 \\pi r$ When r = 5 cm, $1 0 \\pi ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { s }$ \n\nExample 2 The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per second.

Then, $\\mathrm { V } = x ^ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { S } = 6 x ^ { 2 } .$ where $x$ is a function of time $t$ \n\nNow \n\nTherefore \n\nor \n\nNow \n\nHence,when $x = 1 0 \\mathrm { c m } , { \\frac { d S } { d t } } = 3 . 6 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { s }$ \n\nExample 3 A stone is dropped into a quiet lake and waves move in circles at a speed of 4cm per second.At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is $1 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ how fast is the enclosed area increasing? \n\nSolution The area A of a circle with radius $r$ is given by $\\mathrm { A } = \\pi r ^ { 2 }$ .Therefore, the rate of change of area A with respect to time $t$ is \n\n(By Chain Rule) \n\nIt is given that \n\nTherefore, when $r = 1 0 \\mathrm { c m } , \\frac { d \\mathsf { A } } { d t } = 2 \\pi ( 1 0 ) ( 4 ) = 8 0 \\pi$ \n\nThus, the enclosed area is increasing at the rate of $8 0 \\pi \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { s } .$ when $r = 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ \n\n$\\left. \\sum \\mathbf { N o t e } \\right| \\frac { d y } { d x }$ is positive if $y$ increases as $x$ increases and is negativeify decreases   \nas $x$ increases. \n\nExample 4 The length $x$ of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of 3 cm/minute and the width $y$ is increasing at the rate of $2 \\mathrm { c m } /$ minute. When $x = 1 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ and $y = 6 \\mathrm { c m }$ find the rates of change of (a) the perimeter and (b) the area of the rectangle. \n\nSolution Since the length $x$ is decreasing and the width $y$ is increasing with respect to time, we have \n\n(a） The perimeter $\\mathrm { P }$ of a rectangle is given by \n\nTherefore \n\n(b） The area A of the rectangle is given by \n\nTherefore \n\nExample 5 The total cost $\\mathrm { C } ( { \\boldsymbol { x } } )$ in Rupees, associated with the production of $x$ units of an item is given by \n\nFind the marginal cost when 3 units are produced, where by marginal cost we mean the instantaneous rate of change of total cost at any level of output. \n\nSolution Since marginal cost is the rate of change of total cost with respect to the output, we have \n\nMarginal \n\nWhen \n\nHence, the required marginal cost is $\\yen 30.02$ (nearly). \n\nExample 6 The total revenue in Rupees received from the sale of $x$ units of a product is given by $\\mathrm { R } ( x ) = 3 x ^ { 2 } + 3 6 x + 5$ .

Observe that as we move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases. For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers $x > 0$ \n\nNow consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases. Consequently, the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers $x < 0$ \n\nWe shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is increasing or decreasing on an interval. \n\nDefinition 1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f. Then $f$ is said to be \n\n(i) increasing on Iif $x _ { 1 } < x _ { 2 }$ in $\\mathrm { I } \\Rightarrow f ( x _ { 1 } ) \\leq f ( x _ { 2 } )$ for all $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in \\mathrm { ~ I ~ }$ (ii) decreasing on I, if $x _ { 1 } < x _ { 2 }$ in $\\mathrm { I } \\Rightarrow f ( x _ { 1 } ) \\geq f ( x _ { 2 } )$ for all $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in \\mathrm { I }$ (ii) constant on I, if $f ( x ) = c$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm { I }$ where $c$ is a constant. \n\n(iv） strictly increasing on Iif $x _ { 1 } < x _ { 2 }$ in $\\mathrm { I } \\Rightarrow f ( x _ { 1 } ) < f ( x _ { 2 } )$ for all $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in \\mathrm { ~ I ~ }$ \n\n(v）strictly decreasing on Iif $x _ { 1 } < x _ { 2 }$ in $\\mathrm { I } \\Rightarrow f ( x _ { 1 } ) > f ( x _ { 2 } )$ for all $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in \\mathrm { ~ I ~ }$ \n\nFor graphical representation of such functions see Fig 6.2. \n\nWe shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point. \n\nDefinition 2 Let $x _ { _ { 0 } }$ be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function $f .$ Then $f$ is said to be increasing, decreasing at $x _ { 0 }$ if there exists an open interval I containing $x _ { 0 }$ such that $f$ is increasing, decreasing, respectively, in I. \n\nLet us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function. \n\nExample 7 Show that the function given $\\mathrm { b y } f ( x ) = 7 x - 3$ is increasing on R. \n\nSolution Let $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ be any two numbers in R. Then \n\nThus, by Definition 1, it follows thatfis strictly increasing on R. \n\nWe shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions. The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5. \n\nTheorem 1 Let $f$ be continuous on $[ a , b ]$ and differentiable on the open interval $( a , b )$ .Then \n\n(a) $f$ is increasing in $[ a , b ]$ if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) \\geq 0$ for each $x \\in ( a , b )$ (b） $f$ is decreasing in $[ a , b ]$ if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) \\leq 0$ for each $x \\in ( a , b )$ (c） $f$ is a constant function in $[ a , b ]$ if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ for each $x \\in ( a , b )$ \n\nProof (a) Let $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in [ a , b ]$ be such that $x _ { 1 } < x _ { 2 }$ \n\nThen, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point $c$ between $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ such that \n\ni.e. \n\ni.e. \n\nThus, we have \n\nHence, $f$ is an increasing function in $[ a , b ]$ \n\nThe proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar. It is left as an exercise to the reader. \n\nRemarks \n\nThere is a more generalised theorem, which states that if $f \\not \\in ( x ) > 0$ for $x$ in an interval excluding the end points andfis continuous in the interval, then fis increasing. Similarly, if $f \\phi ( x ) < 0$ for $x$ in an interval excluding the end points and $f$ is continuous in the interval, then $f$ is decreasing. \n\nExample 8 Show that the function $f$ given by \n\nis increasing on R. \n\nSolution Note that \n\nTherefore, the function $f$ is increasing on $\\mathbf { R }$ \n\nExample 9 Prove that the function given by $f ( x ) = \\cos x$ is \n\n(a) decreasing in $( 0 , \\pi )$   \n(b）increasing in $( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$ ,and   \n(c）neither increasing nor decreasing in $( 0 , 2 \\pi )$ \n\nSolution Note that $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = - \\sin { x }$ \n\n(a) Since for each $x \\in ( 0 , \\pi )$ ,sin $x > 0$ ,we have $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ and $\\operatorname { s o } f$ is decreasing in $( 0 , \\pi )$   \n(b） Since for each $x \\in ( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$ sin $x < 0$ we have $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ and so $f$ is increasing in $( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$   \n(c）Clearly by (a) and (b) above, $f$ is neither increasing nor decreasing in $( 0 , 2 \\pi )$ \n\nExample 10 Find the intervals in which the function $f$ given by $f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 } - 4 x + 6$ is \n\n(a) increasing (b） decreasing Solution We have \n\nor \n\nTherefore, $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = 2 .$ Now the point $x = 2$ divides the real line into two disjoint intervals namely, $( - \\infty , 2 )$ and $( 2 , \\infty )$ (Fig 6.3). In the interval $( - \\infty , 2 ) , f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 2 x$ $- 4 < 0$ \n\nTherefore, $f$ is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval $( 2 , \\infty ) , f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ and so the function $f$ is increasing in this interval. \n\nExample 11 Find the intervals in which the functionfgiven l $) \\mathrm { y } f ( x ) = 4 x ^ { 3 } - 6 x ^ { 2 } - 7 2 x$ $+ 3 0$ is (a) increasing (b) decreasing. \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nTherefore, $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = - 2 , 3$ The points $x = - 2$ and $x = 3$ divides the real line into three disjoint intervals,namely, $( - \\infty , - 2 ) , ( - 2 , 3 )$ and $( 3 , \\infty )$ \n\nIn the intervals $( - \\infty , - 2 )$ and $( 3 , \\infty ) , f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ is positive while in the interval $( - 2 , 3 )$ $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ is negative. Consequently, the function $f$ is increasing in the intervals $( - \\infty , - 2 )$ and $( 3 , \\infty )$ while the function is decreasing in the interval(-2,3).However, $f$ is neither increasing nor decreasing in R. \n\nExaplees $\\operatorname { y } f ( x ) = \\sin 3 x , \\ x \\in \\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ is (a) increasing (b) decreasing. \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nTherbor $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ givs $3 x = 0$ $3 x = \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 }$ (as $x \\in \\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ implies $3 x \\in { \\left[ 0 , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] } .$ So $x = \\frac { \\pi } { 6 }$ and $\\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ The point $x = \\frac { \\pi } { 6 }$ divides the interval $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } } \\right)$ $\\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ ? into two disjoint intervals and 0 \n\nNow, $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } } \\right)$ as $0 \\leq x < \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } \\Rightarrow 0 \\leq 3 x < \\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ and $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ for all $x \\in \\left( \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right) \\mathrm { ~ a s ~ } \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } < x < \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\Rightarrow \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } < 3 x < \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } .$ \n\nTherefore, $f$ is inereasigin $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } } \\right)$ andereasigin(2) \n\nAlsothegive $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac { \\pi } { 6 }$ Therefore, by Theorem 1, $f$ isi ${ \\mathrm { c r e a s i n g ~ o n ~ } } { \\left[ 0 , \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } \\right] } { \\mathrm { ~ a n d ~ d e c r e a s i n g ~ o n ~ } } { \\left[ \\frac { \\pi } { 6 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right] } .$ \n\nExample 13 Find the intervals in which the functionfgiven by \n\nis increasing or decreasing. \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nNow $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives sin $x = \\cos x $ which gives that $x = \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } , \\frac { 5 \\pi } { 4 }$ as $0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\pi$ \n\nThe points $x = \\frac { \\pi } { 4 }$ and x = $x = \\frac { 5 \\pi } { 4 }$ divide the interval $[ 0 , 2 \\pi ]$ into three disjoint intervals, $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } } , { \\frac { 5 \\pi } { 4 } } \\right) { \\mathrm { a n d } } \\left( { \\frac { 5 \\pi } { 4 } } , 2 \\pi \\right] .$ re 4 5 2π namely \n\nNote thatf'(x)>0 if $x \\in \\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } } \\right) \\cup \\left( { \\frac { 5 \\pi } { 4 } } , 2 \\pi \\right]$ \n\nor \n\n$f$ $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } } \\right)$ und $\\left( { \\frac { 5 \\pi } { 4 } } , 2 \\pi \\right]$ \n\nAlso \n\nor \n\nEXERCISE 6.2 \n\n1． Show that the function given by $f ( x ) = 3 x + 1 7$ is increasing on R. \n\n2.

In fact, we willfind the ‘turning points' of the graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or lowest) locally. The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of a given function. Further, we willalso find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems. \n\nLet us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life. \n\n(i) The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by $\\operatorname { P } ( x ) = a x + b x ^ { 2 } . $ where $^ { a , b }$ are constants and $x$ is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per acre will maximise the profit?   \n(ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building 6O metres high, travels along a path given by $h ( x ) = 6 0 + x - { \\frac { x ^ { 2 } } { 6 0 } }$ where $x$ is the horizontal distance from the building and $h ( x )$ is the height of the ball .What is the maximum height the ball will reach?   \n(ii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve $f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 } + 7$ . A soldier, placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter when it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance? \n\nIn each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out the maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems, we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local maxima and minima and test for determining such points. \n\nDefinition 3 Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval I. Then \n\n（a） $f$ is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point $c$ in I such that $f ( c ) > f ( x )$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm { I }$ The number $f ( c )$ is called the maximum value offin Iand the point $c$ is called a point of maximum value of $f$ in I.   \n（b） $f$ is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point $c$ in I such that $f ( c ) < f ( x )$ ,for all $x \\in \\mathrm { I }$ The number $f ( c )$ , in this case,is called the minimum value offin Iand the point $c$ ,in this case, is called a point of minimum value of $f$ in I.   \n(c） $f$ is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point $c$ in I such that $f ( c )$ is either a maximum value or a minimum value of $f$ in I. \n\nThe number $f ( c )$ , in this case, is called an extreme value of $f$ in I and the point $c$ is called an extreme point. \n\nRemark In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular functions help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it is not even differentiable (Example 15). \n\nExample 14 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function $f$ given by \n\nSolution From the graph ofthe given function (Fig 6.8), we have $f ( x ) = 0$ if $x = 0$ Also \n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $f$ is O and the point of minimum value of $f$ is $x = 0$ . Further, it may be observed from the graph of the function that $f$ has no maximum value and hence no point of maximum value of $f$ in R. \n\nNoteIf we restrict the domain of $f$ to [- 2, 1] only, then f will have maximum value $( - 2 ) ^ { 2 } = 4$ at $x = - 2$ \n\nExample 15 Find the maximum and minimum values of $f$ , if any, of the function given by $f ( x ) = | x | , x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ \n\nSolution From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.9), note that \n\nTherefore, the function $f$ has a minimum value 0 and the point of minimum value of $\\cdot _ { f }$ is $x = 0$ Also, the graph clearly shows that $f$ has no maximum value in R and hence no point of maximum value in R. \n\nNote \n\n(i) Ifwerestrictthe domainoffto[-2,1]only, thenfwillhave maximumvalue $| - 2 | = 2$ \n\n(ii) One may note that the function $f$ in Example 27 is not differentiable at $x = 0$ \n\nExample 16 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function given by \n\nSolution The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval (0, 1). From the graph $( \\mathrm { F i g } 6 . 1 0 )$ of the function $f$ it seems that, it should have the minimum value at a point closest to O on its right and the maximum value at a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points available? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate such points. Infact, if a point $x _ { 0 }$ is closest to O, then we find $\\frac { x _ { 0 } } { 2 } < x _ { 0 }$ for all $x _ { 0 } \\in ( 0 , 1 )$ .Also,if $\\dot { x } _ { 1 }$ is closest to 1, then ${ \\frac { x _ { 1 } + 1 } { 2 } } > x _ { 1 }$ for all $x _ { 1 } \\in ( 0 , 1 )$ \n\nTherefore, the given function has neither the maximum value nor the minimum value in the interval(0,1) \n\nRemark The reader may observe that in Example 16,if we include the points O and 1 in the domain of $f$ , i.e., if we extend the domain of $f$ to [0,1], then the function $f$ has minimum value O at $x = 0$ and maximum value l at $x = 1$ . Infact, we have the following results (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text) \n\nEvery monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end points of the domain of definition of the function. \n\nA more general result is \n\nEvery continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum value. \n\nNote By a monotonic function $f$ in an interval I, we mean that $f$ is either increasing in I or decreasing in I. \n\nMaximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be discussed later in this section. \n\nLet us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.11. Observe that at points A,B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to increasing or vice-versa. These points may be called turning points of the given function.Further, observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little valley. Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood (interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective valleys. Similarly, the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B and D which are at the top of their respective hills. For this reason, the points A and C may be regarded as points of local minimum value (or relative minimum value) and points B and D may be regarded as points of local maximum value (or relative maximum value) for the function. The local maximum value and local minimum value of the function are referred to as local maxima and local minima, respectively, of the function. \n\nWe now formally give the following definition \n\nDefinition 4 Let $f$ be a real valued function and let $c$ be an interior point in the domain of $f .$ Then \n\n(a） $c$ is called a point of local maxima if there is an $h > 0$ such that \n\nThe value $f ( c )$ is called the local maximum value of $f .$ \n\n(b） $c$ is called a point of local minima if there is an $h > 0$ such that \n\nThe value $f ( \\mathbf { c } )$ is called the local minimum value of $f$ \n\nGeometrically, the above definition states that if $x = c$ is a point oflocal maxima of $f ,$ then the graph offaround $c$ will be as shown in Fig 6.12(a). Note that the function $f$ is increasing (i.e., $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0 )$ in the interval $( c - h , c )$ and decreasing (i.e. $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0 )$ in the interval $( c , c + h )$ \n\nThis suggests that $f ^ { \\prime } ( c )$ must be zero. \n\nSimilarly, if $c$ is a point of local minima off,then the graph offaround $c$ will be as shown in Fig 6.14(b). Here $f$ is decreasing (i.e. $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0 )$ in the interval $( c - h , c )$ and increasing (i.e., $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0 )$ in the interval $( c , c + h )$ . This again suggest that $f ^ { \\prime } ( c )$ must be zero. \n\nThe above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof). \n\nTheorem 2 Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval I. Suppose $c \\in \\mathrm { I }$ be any point. $\\operatorname { I f } f$ has a local maxima or a local minima at $x = c$ ,then either $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ or $f$ is not differentiable at $c$ \n\nRemark The converse of above theorem need not be true, that is,a point at which the derivative vanishes need not be a point of local maxima or local minima. For example, if $f ( x ) = x ^ { 3 }$ ，then $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 3 x ^ { 2 }$ and so $f ^ { \\prime } ( 0 ) { = } 0 .$ But O is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima (Fig 6.13). \n\nNote| A point c in the domain ofa functionfat which either $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ or $f$ is not differentiable is called acritical point off. Note that iffis continuous at $c$ and $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ , then there exists an $h > 0$ such that $f$ is differentiable in the interval $( c - h , c + h )$ \n\nWe shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of local minima using only the first order derivatives. \n\nTheorem 3 (First Derivative Test) Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval I. Let fbe continuous at a critical point $c$ in I. Then \n\ni $\\operatorname { I f } f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ changes sign from positive to negative as $x$ increases through c,i.e., if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of $c$ and $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of $c$ ,then $c$ is a point of local maxima.   \n(ii) If $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ changes sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through $c$ ,i.e.,if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ at every point suficiently close to and to the left of $c$ and $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of $c$ ,then $c$ is a point of local minima.   \n(111) $\\operatorname { I f } f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ does not change sign as $x$ increases through $c$ ,then $c$ is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called point of inflection (Fig 6.13). \n\nNoteIf $c$ is a point of local maxima off, then $f ( c )$ is a local maximum value of f. Similarly, if $c$ is a point oflocal minima off,then $f ( c )$ is a local minimum value off. \n\nFigures 6.13 and 6.14, geometrically explain Theorem 3. \n\nExample 17 Find all points of local maxima and local minima of the function $f$ given by \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nor \n\nThus, $x = \\pm 1$ are the only critical points which could possbly be the points of local maxima and/or local minima off. Let us first examine the point $x = 1$ \n\nNote that for values close to 1 and to the right of $1 , f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ and for values close to l and to the left of $1 , f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ .Therefore,by first derivative test, $x = 1$ is a point of local minima and local minimum value is $f ( 1 ) = 1$ . In the case of $x = - 1$ , note that $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ ,for values close to and to the left of $^ { - 1 }$ and $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ ,for values close to and to the right of-1. Therefore, by first derivative test, $x = - 1$ is a point of local maxima and local maximum value is $f ( - 1 ) = 5$ \n\nExample 18 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function $f$ given by \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nor \n\nThus, $x = 1$ is the only critical point of $f$ .We shall now examine this point for local maxima and/or local minima off. Observe that $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and in particular $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ ,for values close to 1 and to the left and to the right of 1. Therefore, by first derivative test, the point $x = 1$ is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima. Hence $x = 1$ is a point of inflexion. \n\nRemark One may note that since $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ , in Example 30, never changes its sign on R, graph offhas no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima. \n\nWe shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a given function. This test is often easier to apply than the first derivative test. \n\nTheorem 4 (Second Derivative Test) Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval I and $c \\in \\operatorname { I } .$ Let $f$ be twice differentiable at $c$ Then \n\ni $x = c$ is a point of local maxima if $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ and $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( c ) < 0$ The value $f ( c )$ is local maximum value of $f$   \n(ii) $x = c$ is a point of local minima if $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ and $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( c ) > 0$ In this case, $f ( c )$ is local minimum value of $f$   \n(iii)The test fails if $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ and $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ \n\nIn this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether $c$ is a point of local maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion. \n\nNote As $f$ is twice differentiable at $c$ ，we mean second order derivative of $f$ exists at $c$ \n\nExample 19 Find local minimum value of the function $f$ given by $f ( x ) = 3 + | x | , x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ \n\nSolution Note that the given function is not differentiable at $x \\ = 0$ . So, second derivative test fails.Let us try first derivative test. Note that O is a critical point off. Now to the left of $0 , f ( x ) = 3 - x$ and so $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = - 1 < 0 .$ Also to the right of $0 , f ( x ) = 3 + x$ and so $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 1 > 0 .$ Therefore,by first derivative test, $x =$ O is a point of local minima of $f$ and local minimum value of $f$ is $f ( 0 ) = 3$ \n\nExample 20 Find local maximum and local minimum values of the function $f$ given by \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nor \n\nNow \n\nor \n\nTherefore, by second derivative test, $x \\ = 0$ is a point of local maxima and local maximum value offat $x = 0$ is $f ( 0 ) = 1 2$ while $x = 1$ and $x = - 2$ are the points of local minima and local minimum values offat $x = - 1$ and $^ { - 2 }$ are $f ( 1 ) = 7$ and $f ( - 2 ) = - 2 0$ respectively. \n\nExample 21 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function $f$ given by \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nNow $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = 1$ . Also $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( 1 ) = 0$ .Therefore, the second derivative test fails in this case. So, we shall go back to the first derivative test. \n\nWe have already seen (Example 18) that, using first derivative test, $x = 1$ is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion. \n\nExample 22 Find two positive numbers whose sum is 15 and the sum of whose squares is minimum. \n\nSolution Let one of the numbers be $x$ .Then the other number is $( 1 5 - x )$ .Let $\\mathrm { S } ( x )$ denote the sum of the squares of these numbers.Then \n\nor \n\nNow $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 }$ .Also $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime } \\left( \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 } \\right) = 4 > 0$ .Therefore,by second derivative test, $x = \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 }$ is the point of local minima of S.Hence the sum of squares of numbers is minimum when the numbers are $\\frac { 1 5 } { 2 }$ and $1 5 - { \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 } } = { \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 } }$ \n\nRemark Proceeding as in Example 34 one may prove that the two positive numbers, whose sum is $k$ and the sum of whose squares is minii are ${ \\frac { k } { 2 } } \\operatorname { a n d } { \\frac { k } { 2 } } .$ \n\nExample 23 Find the shortest distance of the point $( 0 , c )$ from the parabola $y = x ^ { 2 }$ where ${ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } \\leq c \\leq 5 .$ U \n\nSolution Let $( h , k )$ be any point on the parabola $y = x ^ { 2 }$ . Let D be the required distance between $( h , k )$ and $( 0 , c )$ .Then \n\nSince $( h , k )$ lies on the parabola $y = x ^ { 2 }$ ,we have $k = h ^ { 2 }$ So (1) gives \n\nor \n\nNow \n\nObserve that when $k < \\frac { 2 c - 1 } { 2 }$ , then $2 ( k - c ) + 1 < 0$ ,i.e, $\\mathrm { D } ^ { \\prime } ( k ) < 0$ . Also when $k > \\frac { 2 c - 1 } { 2 }$ , then $\\mathrm { D } ^ { \\prime } ( k ) > 0$ . So, byfirst ervative est, $\\mathrm { D } \\left( k \\right)$ is minimum at $k = \\frac { 2 c - 1 } { 2 }$ \n\nHence,the required shortest distance is given by \n\nNoteThe reader may note that in Example 35, we have used first derivative test instead of the second derivative test as the former is easy and short. \n\nExample 24 Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at points A and B, respectively. If $\\mathrm { A P } = 1 6 \\mathrm { m }$ $\\mathrm { B Q } = 2 2 \\mathrm { m }$ and $\\mathrm { A B } = 2 0 \\mathrm { m }$ ,then find the distance of a point R on AB from the point A such that $\\mathrm { R P } ^ { 2 } + \\mathrm { R Q } ^ { 2 }$ is minimum. \n\nSolution Let R be a point on AB such that $\\operatorname { A R } = x$ m. Then $\\mathrm { R B } = ( 2 0 - x ) \\mathrm { m }$ (as $\\mathrm { A B } = 2 0 \\mathrm { m }$ ). From Fig 6.16, we have \n\nand \n\nTherefore \n\nLet \n\nTherefore \n\nNow $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = 1 0 .$ Also $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( x ) = 4 > 0$ ，for all $x$ and so $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( 1 0 ) > 0$ Therefore, by second derivative test, $x = 1 0$ is the point of local minima of S. Thus, the distance of R from A on AB is $\\mathrm { A R } = x = 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { m } .$ \n\nExample 25 If length of three sides of a trapezium other than base are equal to $1 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ then find the area of the trapezium when it is maximum. \n\nSolution The required trapezium is as given in Fig 6.17. Draw perpendiculars DP and \n\nCQ on AB. Let $\\operatorname { A P } = x$ cm. Note that $\\Delta \\mathrm { A P D } \\sim \\Delta \\mathrm { B Q C } .$ Therefore, $\\mathrm { Q B } = x$ cm. Also, by Pythagoras theorem, ${ \\mathrm { D P } } = { \\mathrm { Q C } } = { \\sqrt { 1 0 0 - x ^ { 2 } } }$ . Let A be the area of the trapezium. Then \n\nor \n\n$\\mathrm { A } ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $2 x ^ { 2 } + 1 0 x - 1 0 0 = 0 ,$ i.e., $x = 5$ and $x = - 1 0$ \n\nSince $x$ represents distance, it can not be negative. \n\nSo, \n\nor \n\nThus, area of trapezium is maximum at $x = 5$ and the area is given by \n\nExample 26 Prove that the radius of the right circular cylinder of greatest curved surface area which can be inscribed in a given cone is half of that of the cone. \n\nSolution Let $\\mathrm { O C } = r$ be the radius of the cone and $\\mathrm { O A } = h$ be its height. Let a cylinder with radius $\\mathrm { O E } = x$ inscribed in the given cone $( \\mathrm { F i g } 6 . 1 8 )$ . The height QE ofthe cylinder is given by \n\nor \n\nor \n\nLet S be the curved surface area of the given cylinder. Then \n\nor \n\nNow $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = { \\frac { r } { 2 } } .$ Since $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ for all x, $\\mathrm { S } ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\left( \\frac { r } { 2 } \\right) < 0$ .So $x = \\frac { r } { 2 }$ is a point of maxima of S. Hence, the radius of the cylinder of greatest curved surface area which can be inscribed in a given cone is half of that of the cone. \n\n6.4.1 Maximum and Minimum Values of a Function in a Closed Interval \n\nLet us consider a function $f$ given by \n\nObserve that the function is continuous on $( 0 , 1 )$ and neither has a maximum value nor has a minimum value. Further, we may note that the function even has neither a local maximum value nor a local minimum value. \n\nHowever, if we extend the domain of $f$ to the closed interval[O,1],thenfstill may not have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value $3 = f ( 1 )$ and minimum value $2 = f ( 0 )$ .The maximum value 3 of $f$ at $x = 1$ is called absolute maximum value (global maximum or greatest value) of $f$ on the interval [0,1]. Similarly, the minimum value 2 of $f$ at $x = 0$ is called the absolute minimum value (global minimum or least value) of $f$ on [0, 1]. \n\nConsider the graph given in Fig 6.19 of a continuous function defined on a closed interval [a, d]. Observe that the function $f$ has a local minima at $x = b$ and local minimum value is $f ( b )$ . The function also has a local maxima at $x = c$ and local maximum value is $f ( c )$ 1 \n\nAlso from the graph, it is evident that $f$ has absolute maximum value $f ( a )$ and absolute minimum value $f ( d )$ . Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum) value of $f$ is different from local maximum (minimum) value off. \n\nWe will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I. \n\nTheorem 5 Let $f$ be a continuous function on an interval $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { I } } = \\left[ a , b \\right]$ .Then $f$ has the absolute maximum value and $f$ attains it at least once in I. Also, $f$ has the absolute minimum value and attains it at least once in I. \n\nTheorem 6 Let $f$ be a differentiable function on a closed interval I ad let $c$ be any interior point of I. Then \n\ni $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ if $f$ attains its absolute maximum value at $c$ (ii) $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ if $f$ attains its absolute minimum value at $c$ \n\nIn view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval $[ a , b ]$ \n\nWorking Rule \n\nStep 1: Find all critical points of $f$ in the interval, i.e., find points $x$ where either $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ or $f$ is not differentiable. \n\nStep 2: Take the end points of the interval. \n\nStep 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of $f$ \n\nStep 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of $f$ out of the values calculated in Step 3. This maximum value willbe the absolute maximum(greatest) value of $f$ and the minimum value willbe the absolute minimum (least) value of $f$ \n\nExample 27 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values ofa functionfgiven by \n\n$f ( x ) = 2 x ^ { 3 } - 1 5 x ^ { 2 } + 3 6 x + 1$ on the interval[1, 5]. \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nNote that $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = 2$ and $x = 3$ \n\nWe shall now evaluate the value of $f$ at these points and at the end points of the interval [1, 5], i.e., at $x = 1 , x = 2 , x = 3$ and at $x = 5$ So \n\nThus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of $f$ on [1, 5] is 56,occurring at $x = 5$ ,and absolute minimum value offon [1,5] is 24 which occurs at $x = 1$ \n\nExample 28 Find absolute maximum and minimum values ofa functionfgiven by \n\nSolution We have \n\nor \n\nThus, $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = \\frac { 1 } { 8 }$ Further note that $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ is not defined at $x = 0$ . So the critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac { 1 } { 8 }$ . Now evaluating the value of $f$ at critical points $x = 0 , \\frac { 1 } { 8 }$ and at end points of the interval $x = - 1$ and $x = 1$ we have \n\nHence, we conclude that absolute maximum value of $f$ is 18 that occurs at $x = - 1$ and absolte minimum value $\\mathrm { \\ p f { \\it f i s } } \\ \\frac { - 9 } { 4 }$ that ocus at $x = { \\frac { 1 } { 8 } } .$ \n\nExample 29 An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the curve given by $y = x ^ { 2 } + 7 .$ . A soldier, placed at (3, 7), wants to shoot down the helicopter when it is nearest to him.Find the nearest distance. \n\nSolution For each value of $x$ ,the helicopter's position is at point $( x , x ^ { 2 } + 7 )$ Therefore, the distance between the helicopter and the soldier placed at (3,7) is \n\nLet \n\nor \n\nThus, $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ gives $x = 1$ or $2 x ^ { 2 } + 2 x + 3 = 0$ for which there are no real roots. Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which $f ^ { \\prime }$ is zero, i.e., there is only one point, namely, $x = 1 .$ The value of $f$ at this point is given by $f ( 1 ) = ( 1 - 3 ) ^ { 2 } + ( 1 ) ^ { 4 } = 5 .$ Thus, the distance between the solider and the helicopter is ${ \\sqrt { f ( 1 ) } } = { \\sqrt { 5 } }$ \n\nNote that $\\sqrt { 5 }$ is either a maximum value or a minimum value. Since \n\nit follows that $\\sqrt { 5 }$ is the minimum value of $\\sqrt { f ( x ) }$ . Hence, $\\sqrt { 5 }$ is the minimum distance between the soldier and the helicopter. \n\nEXERCISE 6.3 \n\n1． Find the maximum and minimum values, if any, of the following functions given by \n\n2.

Let $f$ be continuous at a critical point $c$ in I. Then \n\n$\\operatorname { I f } f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ changes sign from positive to negative as $x$ increases through c, i.e., if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of $c$ and $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of $c$ then $c$ is a point of local maxima. \n\n(ii) $\\operatorname { I f } f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ changes sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through $c$ ， i.e., if $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) < 0$ at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of $c$ ， and $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) > 0$ at every point suffciently close to and to the right of $c$ then $c$ is a point of local minima.   \n(m) $\\operatorname { I f } f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ does not change sign as $x$ increases through $c$ ,then $c$ is neither a point oflocal maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called point of inflexion. \n\nSecond Derivative Test Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval I and $c \\in \\operatorname { I } .$ Let $f$ be twice differentiable at $c$ Then \n\n(i) $x = c$ is a point of local maxima if $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ and $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( c ) < 0$ The values $f ( c )$ is local maximum value of $f$ she   \n(i) $x = c$ is a point of local minima if $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ and $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( c ) > 0$ In this case, $f ( c )$ is local minimum value of $f$ ·   \n(ii) The test fails if $f ^ { \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ and $f ^ { \\prime \\prime } ( c ) = 0$ In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether $c$ is a point of maxima, minima or a point of inflexion. \n\nWorking rule for finding absolute maxima and/or absolute minima \n\nStep 1: Find all critical points of $f$ in the interval, i.e., find points $x$ where either $f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = 0$ or $f$ is not differentiable. \n\nStep 2:Take the end points of the interval. \n\nStep 3: At al these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of $f$ \n\nStep 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of $f$ out of the values calculated in Step 3.

VLADIMIR ARNOLD \n\nA.1.1 Introduction \n\nIn Classes IX, X and XI, we have learnt about the concepts of a statement, compound statement, negation, converse and contrapositive of a statement; axioms, conjectures, theorems and deductive reasoning. 一 \n\nHere, we will discuss various methods of proving mathematical propositions. \n\nA.1.2 What is a Proof? \n\nProof of a mathematical statement consists of sequence of statements, each statement being justified with a definition or an axiom or a proposition that is previously established by the method of deduction using only the allowed logical rules. \n\nThus, each proof is a chain of deductive arguments each of which has its premises and conclusions.Many a times, we prove a proposition directly from what is given in the proposition. But some times it is easier to prove an equivalent proposition rather than proving the proposition itself. This leads to, two ways of proving a proposition directly or indirectly and the proofs obtained are called direct proof and indirect proof and further each has three different ways of proving which is discussed below. \n\nDirect Proof It is the proof of a proposition in which we directly start the proof with what is given in the proposition. \n\n(i)Straight forward approach It is a chain of arguments which leads directly from what is given or assumed, with the help of axioms, definitions or already proved theorems, to what is to be proved using rules of logic. Consider the following example: \n\nExample 1 Show that if $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 = 0$ then $x = 3$ or $x = 2$ \n\nSolution $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 = 0$ (given) \n\n$\\Rightarrow ( x - 3 ) ( x - 2 ) = 0$ (replacing an expression by an equal/equivalent expression) $\\implies x - 3 = 0$ or $x - 2 = 0$ (from the established theorem $a b = 0 \\Rightarrow$ either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ for $a$ $^ { b }$ in R) \n\n$\\Rightarrow \\ x - 3 + 3 = 0 + 3$ or $x - 2 + 2 = 0 + 2$ (adding equal quantities on either side of the equation does not alter the nature of the equation) \n\n$\\Rightarrow \\ x + 0 = 3 \\ { \\mathrm { o r } } x + 0 = 2$ (using the identity property of integers under addition) \n\n$\\implies x = 3$ or $x = 2$ (using the identity property of integers under addition) \n\nHence, $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 = 0$ implies $x = 3$ or $x = 2$ \n\nExplanation Let $p$ be the given statement $\\ ^ { \\cdot \\ c } x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 = 0 ^ { \\cdot \\ }$ and $q$ be the conclusion statement $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { { \\hat { x } } } } = 3$ or $x = 2 ^ { \\circ }$ \n\nFrom the statement $p$ ， we deduced the statement $r \\colon ^ { \\mathfrak { s c } } ( x - 3 ) ( x - 2 ) = 0 ^ { { \\mathfrak { s } } ^ { } }$ by replacing the expression $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6$ in the statement $p$ by another expression $( x - 3 )$ $( x - 2 )$ which is equal to $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6$ \n\nThere arise two questions: \n\n(i) How does the expression $\\left( x - 3 \\right) \\left( x - 2 \\right)$ is equal to the expression $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 ?$ (ii) How can we replace an expression with another expression which is equal to the former? \n\nThe first one is proved in earlier classes by factorization,i.e., \n\nThe second one is by valid form ofargumentation (rules of logic) \n\nNext this statement $r$ becomes premises or given and deduce the statement $s$ “ $x - 3 = 0$ or $x - 2 = 0 ^ { , }$ and the reasons are given in the brackets. \n\nThis process continues till we reach the conclusion. \n\nThe symbolic equivalent of the argumentis to prove by deduction that $p \\Rightarrow q$ is true. \n\nStarting with $p$ , we deduce $p \\Rightarrow r \\Rightarrow s \\Rightarrow \\ldots \\Rightarrow q \\qquad $ . This implies that $ { \\boldsymbol { p } } \\Rightarrow q ^ {  { \\boldsymbol { \\cdot } } }$ is true. \n\nExample 2 Prove that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } \\quad$ \n\nSolution Note that a function $f$ is one-one if \n\nNow, given that \n\n$\\Rightarrow$ \n\n$2 x _ { 1 } + 5 - 5 = 2 x _ { 2 } + 5 - 5$ (adding the same quantity on both sides) \n\nHence, the given function is one-one. \n\n(ii) Mathematical Induction \n\nMathematical induction, is a strategy, of proving a proposition which is deductive in nature. The whole basis of proof of this method depends on the following axiom: \n\nFor a given subset S of $\\mathbf { N }$ if \n\n(i) the natural number $1 \\in \\mathrm { S }$ and (i) the natural number $k + 1 \\in \\mathrm { S }$ whenever $k \\in \\mathrm { S }$ then $\\mathbf { S } = \\mathbf { N }$ \n\nAccording to the principle of mathematical induction, if a statement $^ { \\mathrm { { \\tiny ~ c c } } } \\mathrm { { \\bf S } } ( n )$ is true for $n = 1 ^ { \\circ }$ (or for some starting point j), and if ${ \\mathrm { { } ^ { . . } S } } ( n )$ is true for $n = k ^ { \\prime }$ implies that “ $\\mathbf { \\ddot { S } } ( n )$ is true for $n = k + 1 ^ { \\circ }$ (whatever integer $k \\geq j$ may be), then the statement is true for any positive integer $n$ , for all $n \\geq j$ \n\nWe now consider some examples. \n\nExample 3 Show that if \n\nSolution We have \n\nWe note that \n\nTherefore, P(1) is true. \n\nAssume that $\\mathrm { P } ( k )$ is true, i.e., \n\nWe want to prove that $\\mathrm { P } ( k + 1 )$ is true whenever $\\mathrm { P } ( k )$ is true, i.e., \n\nNow \n\nSince $\\mathrm { P } ( k )$ is true, we have \n\n(by matrix multiplication) \n\nThus, $\\mathrm { P } ( k + 1 )$ is true whenever $\\mathrm { P } ( k )$ is true. \n\nHence, $\\mathrm { P } ( n )$ is true for all $n \\geq 1$ (by the principle of mathematical induction). \n\n(ii) Proof by cases or by exhaustion \n\nThis method of proving a statement $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is possible only when $p$ can be split into several cases, $r , s , t$ (say) so that $p = r \\vee s \\vee t$ (where $^ { \\circ c } \\vee ^ { \\mathbf { \\alpha } , \\mathbf { \\beta } ) }$ is the symbol for“OR\"). \n\nIf the conditionals \n\nand \n\nare proved, then $( r ~ \\lor ~ s ~ \\lor ~ t ) \\Rightarrow q .$ , is proved and so $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is proved. \n\nThe method consists of examining every possible case of the hypothesis. It is practically convenient only when the number of possible cases are few. \n\nExample 4 Show that in any triangle ABC, \n\nSolution Let $p$ be the statement “ABC is any triangle\" and $q$ be the statement \n\nLet ABC be a triangle. From A draw AD a perpendicular to BC (BC produced if necessary). \n\nAs we know that any triangle has to be either acute or obtuse or right angled, we can split $p$ into three statements $r , s$ and $t .$ where \n\n$r : \\mathrm { A B C }$ is an acute angled triangle with $\\angle \\mathrm { C }$ is acute.   \n$s : { \\mathrm { A B C } }$ is an obtuse angled triangle with $\\angle \\mathrm { C }$ is obtuse.   \n$t : \\mathrm { A B C }$ is a right angled triangle with $\\angle \\mathrm { C }$ is right angle. \n\nHence, we prove the theorem by three cases. \n\nCase $\\mathrm { ( i ) }$ When $\\angle \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ is acute (Fig. A1.1). \n\nFrom the right angled triangle ADB, \n\ni.e. \n\nFrom the right angled triangle ADC, \n\ni.e. \n\nNow \n\nCase (ii) When $\\angle \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ is obtuse (Fig A1.2). \n\nFrom the right angled triangle ADB, \n\ni.e. \n\nFrom the right angled triangle ADC, \n\ni.e. \n\nNow \n\ni.e. \n\nCase (ii) When $\\angle \\mathrm { C }$ is a right angle (Fig A1.3). \n\nFrom the right angled triangle ACB, \n\ni.e. \n\nand \n\nThus, we may write \n\nFrom (1), (2) and (3). We assert that for any triangle ABC, \n\nBy case (i), $r \\Rightarrow q$ is proved. \n\nBy case (i), $s \\Longrightarrow q$ is proved. \n\nBy case (i), $t \\Longrightarrow q$ is proved. \n\nHence, from the proof by cases, $( r ~ \\lor ~ s ~ \\lor ~ t ) \\Rightarrow q$ is proved, i.e., $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is proved. \n\nIndirect Proof Instead of proving the given proposition directly, we establish the proof of the proposition through proving a proposition which is equivalent to the given proposition. \n\n(i) Proof by contradiction (Reductio Ad Absurdum) : Here, we start with the assumption that the given statement is false. By rules of logic, we arrive at a conclusion contradicting the assumption and hence it is inferred that the assumption is wrong and hence the given statement is true. Let us illustrate this method by an example. \n\nExample 5 Show that the set of allprime numbers is infinite. \n\nSolution Let P be the set of all prime numbers. We take the negation of the statement “the set of all prime numbers is infinite”, i.e., we assume the set of all prime numbers tobeiie thatweaveedatsumb $\\mathrm { \\mathrm { P } } _ { 1 }$ $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { P } _ { 3 } , . . . , \\mathrm { P } _ { k }$ $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 } , \\ldots$ P $\\mathrm { P } _ { \\boldsymbol { k } }$ (say). Note N \n\nNow consider ${ \\mathrm { N } } = ( { \\mathrm { P } } _ { 1 } { \\mathrm { P } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { P } } _ { 3 } . . . { \\mathrm { P } } _ { k } ) + 1 \\ldots$ (1) \n\n$_ \\mathrm { N }$ is not in the list as $_ \\mathrm { N }$ is larger than any of the numbers in the list. \n\n$_ \\mathrm { N }$ is either prime or composite. \n\nIf N is a prime, then by(1), there exists a prime number which is not listed. \n\nOn the other hand, ifN is composite, it should have a prime divisor. But none of the numbers in the list can divide N, because they all leave the remainder 1. Hence, the prime divisor should be other than the one in the list. \n\nThus, in both the cases whether N is a prime or a composite, we ended up with contradiction to the fact that we have listed all the prime numbers. \n\nHence, our assumption that set of all prime numbers is finite is false. \n\nThus, the set of all prime numbers is infinite. \n\nNote Observe that the above proof also uses the method of proof by cases. \n\n(ii) Proof by using contrapositive statement of the given statement \n\nInstead of proving the conditional $p \\Rightarrow q$ ， we prove its equivalent, i.e., $\\sim q \\Rightarrow \\sim p$ .(students can verify). \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional can be formed by interchanging the conclusion and the hypothesis and negating both. \n\nExample 6 Prove that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } \\quad$ defined by $f ( x ) = 2 x + 5$ is one-one. \n\nSolution A function is one-one if $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ \n\nUsing this we have to show that ‘ $^ { \\cdot } 2 x _ { 1 } ^ { } + 5 = 2 x _ { 2 } ^ { } + 5 ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\Rightarrow ^ { \\ast } x _ { 1 } ^ { } = { x _ { 2 } ^ { } } ^ { \\prime }$ . This is of the form $p \\Longrightarrow q$ where, $p$ is $2 x _ { 1 } + 5 = 2 x _ { 2 } + 5$ and $q : x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ We have proved this in Example 2 of\"direct method\". \n\nWe can also prove the same by using contrapositive of the statement. Now contrapositive of this statement is $\\sim q \\Rightarrow \\sim p$ , i.e., contrapositive of“if $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } )$ then $x _ { 1 } = { x _ { 2 } } ^ { \\mathfrak { s } }$ is \"if $x _ { 1 } \\neq x _ { 2 } .$ then $f ( x _ { 1 } ) \\neq f ( x _ { 2 } ) ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ \n\nNow \n\n$\\Rightarrow$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\Rightarrow$ \n\nSince $\\displaystyle { } ^ { \\ast } \\sim q \\Rightarrow \\sim p ^ { 3 3 }$ is equivalent to ${ } ^ { \\ast } p \\Rightarrow q ^ { \\ast }$ the proof is complete. \n\nExample 7 Show that \"if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular\". \n\nSolution Writing the above statement in symbolic form, we have $p \\Longrightarrow q$ ,where, $p$ is “matrix A is invertible\" and $q$ is $^ { \\circ \\mathfrak { c } } \\mathbf { A }$ is non singular\" \n\nInstead of proving the given statement, we prove its contrapositive statement, i.e., if A is not a non singular matrix, then the matrix A is not invertible. \n\nIf A is not a non singular matrix,then it means the matrix A is singular,i.e., \n\nThen \n\nHence,A is not invertible. \n\nThus, we have proved that if A is not a non singular matrix, then A is not invertible. i.e., $\\sim q \\Rightarrow \\sim p$ \n\nHence,if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular. \n\n(ii) Proof by a counter example \n\nIn the history of Mathematics, there are occasions when all attempts to find a valid proof of a statement fail and the uncertainty of the truth value of the statement remains unresolved. \n\nIn such a situation, it is beneficial, if we find an example to falsify the statement. The example to disprove the statement is called a counter example. Since the disproof of a proposition $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is merely a proof of the proposition $\\sim ( p \\Rightarrow q )$ .Hence,this is also a method of proof. \n\nExample 8 For each $n , 2 ^ { 2 ^ { n } } + 1$ is a prime $( n \\in \\mathbf { N } )$ \n\nThis was once thought to be true on the basis that \n\nHowever, at first sight the generalisation looks to be correct.But, eventually it was \n\nshown that \n\nwhich is not a prime since $4 2 9 4 9 6 7 2 9 7 = 6 4 1 \\times 6 7 0 0 4 1 7$ (a product of two numbers). \n\nSo the generalisation “For each $n$ $2 ^ { 2 ^ { n } } + 1$ is a prime $( n \\in \\mathbf { N } ) ^ { \\dag }$ is false. \n\nJust this one example $2 ^ { 2 ^ { 5 } } + 1$ is sufficient to disprove the generalisation.This is the counter example. \n\nThus, we have proved that the generalisation“For each $n , 2 ^ { 2 ^ { n } } + 1$ is a prime $( n \\in \\mathbf { N } ) ^ { \\dag }$ is not true in general. \n\nExample 9 Every continuous function is differentiable. \n\nProof We consider some functions given by \n\ni $\\begin{array} { l } { f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 } } \\\\ { g ( x ) = e ^ { x } } \\\\ { h ( x ) = \\sin { x } } \\end{array}$   \n  \n() \n\nThese functions are continuous for all values of $x$ .If we check for their differentiability,we find that they are all differentiable for all the values of $x .$ This makes us to believe that the generalisation “Every continuous function is differentiable\" may be true.But if we check the differentiability of the function given by $\\mathbf { \\hat { \\Psi } } \\phi ( x ) = | x | \\mathbf { \\Psi } ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ which is continuous, we find that it is not differentiable at $x = 0$ .This means that the statement “Every continuous function is differentiable” is false, in general. Just this one function $\\mathbf { \\ddot { \\Psi } } \\phi ( x ) = | x | \\mathbf { \\Psi } ^ { \\ast }$ is sufficient to disprove the statement. Hence, $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\Psi } } \\phi ( x ) = | x | \\mathbf { \\Psi } ^ { \\ast }$ is called a counter example to disprove“Every continuous function is differentiable\".",

Therefore, it is important to study mathematical modelling as a separate topic. \n\nIn this chapter, we shall further study mathematical modelling of some real-life problems using techniques/results from matrix, calculus and linear programming. \n\nA.2.2 Why Mathematical Modelling? \n\nStudents are aware of the solution of word problems in arithmetic,algebra, trigonometry and linear programming etc. Sometimes we solve the problems without going into the physical insight of the situational problems. Situational problems need physical insight that is introduction of physical laws and some symbols to compare the mathematical results obtained with practical values. To solve many problems faced by us, we need a technique and this is what is known as mathematical modelling. Let us consider the following problems: \n\n(i)To find the width of a river (particularly, when it is difficult to cross the river).   \n(ii) To find the optimal angle in case of shot-put (by considering the variables such as : the height of the thrower, resistance of the media, acceleration due to gravity etc.).   \n(ii)To find the height of a tower (particularly, when it is not possible to reach the top of the tower).   \n(iv) To find the temperature at the surface of the Sun.   \n(v）Why heart patients are not allowed to use lift?(without knowing the physiology of a human being).   \n(vi)To find the mass of the Earth.   \n(vii) Estimate the yield of pulses in India from the standing crops (a person is not allowed to cut all of it).   \n(vii) Find the volume of blood inside the body of a person (a person is not allowed to bleed completely).   \n(ix) Estimate the population of India in the year 2020 (a person is not allowed to wait till then). Y \n\nAll of these problems can be solved and infact have been solved with the help of Mathematics using mathematical modelling. In fact, you might have studied the methods for solving some of them in the present textbook itself. However, it will be instructive if you first try to solve them yourself and that too without the help of Mathematics, if possible, you will then appreciate the power of Mathematics and the need for mathematical modelling. 一 \n\nA.2.3 Principles of Mathematical Modelling \n\nMathematical modelling is a principled activity and so it has some principles behind it. These principles are almost philosophical in nature. Some of the basic principles of mathematical modelling are listed below in terms of instructions: \n\n(i) Identify the need for the model. (for what we are looking for)   \n(ii) List the parameters/variables which are required for the modr   \n(iii) Identify the available relevent data. (what is given?)   \n(iv) Identify the circumstances that can be applied (assumptions)   \n(v）Identify the governing physical principles.   \n(vi)Identify (a) the equations that will be used. (b） the calculations that will be made. (c） the solution which will follow.   \n(vii) Identify tests that can check the (a） consistency of the model. (b）utility ofthe model.   \n(viii) Identify the parameter values that can improve the model. \n\nThe above principles of mathematical modelling lead to the following: steps for mathematical modelling. \n\nStep 1: Identify the physical situation. \n\nStep 2: Convert the physical situation into a mathematical model by introducing parameters / variables and using various known physical laws and symbols. \n\nStep 3:Find the solution ofthe mathematical problem. \n\nStep 4: Interpret the result in terms of the original problem and compare the result with observations or experiments. \n\nStep 5: If the result is in good agreement, then accept the model. Otherwise modify the hypotheses / assumptions according to the physical situation and go to Step 2. \n\nThe above steps can also be viewed through the following diagram: \n\nExample 1 Find the height of a given tower using mathematical modelling. \n\nSolution Step 1 Given physical situation is “to find the height of a given tower\". \n\nStep 2 Let AB be the given tower (Fig A.2.2). Let PQ be an observer measuring the height of the tower with his eye at P. Let ${ \\mathrm { P Q } } = h$ and let height of tower be H. Let $\\alpha$ be the angle of elevation from the eye of the observer to the top of the tower. \n\nLet \n\nNow \n\nor \n\nStep 3 Note that the values of the parameters $h , l$ and $\\alpha$ (using sextant) are known to the observer and so (1) gives the solution of the problem. \n\nStep 4 In case, if the foot of the tower is not accessible, i.e., when l is not known to the observer, let $\\beta$ be the angle of depression from $\\mathrm { P }$ to the foot B of the tower. So from $\\Delta \\mathrm { P Q B }$ ，we have \n\nStep 5 is not required in this situation as exact values of the parameters $h , l , \\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are known. \n\nExample 2 Let a business firm produces three types of products $\\mathrm { { P } } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { { P } } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ that uses three types of raw materials $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ 。 $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ . Let the firm has purchase orders from two clients $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ . Considering the situation that the firm has a limited quantity of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ , respectively, prepare a model to determine the quantities of the raw material $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ required to meet the purchase orders. \n\nSolution Step 1 The physical situation is well identified in the problem. \n\nStep 2 Let A be a matrix that represents purchase orders from the two clients $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ .Then,Ais of the form \n\nLet B be the matrix that represents the amount of raw materials $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ required to manufacture each unit of the products $\\mathrm { \\sf P } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { \\sf P } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 } .$ Then,B is of the form \n\nStep 3 Note that the product (which in this case is well defined) of matrices A and B is given by the following matrix \n\nwhich in fact gives the desired quantities of the raw materials $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ to fulfill the purchase orders of the two clients $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ \n\nExample 3 Interpret the model in Example 2, in case \n\nand the available raw materials are 330 units ofR,455 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and 140 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ \n\nSolution Note that \n\nThis clearly shows that to meet the purchase order of $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 } ,$ the raw material required is 335 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ , 467 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and 147 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ which is much more than the available raw material. Since the amount of raw material required to manufacture each unit of the three products is fixed, we can either ask for an increase in the available raw material or we may ask the clients to reduce their orders. \n\nRemark If we replace A in Example 3 by $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ given by \n\ni.e., if the clients agree to reduce their purchase orders, then \n\nThis requires 311 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ ,436 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and 138 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ which are well below the available raw materials,i.e., 330 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ , 455 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and 140 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ .Thus,if the revised purchase orders of the clients are given by $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } ^ { \\phantom { \\dagger } }$ ,then the firm can easily supply the purchase orders of the two clients. \n\nNote|One may further modify A so as to make full use of the available raw material. \n\nQuery Can we make a mathematical model with a given B and with fixed quantities of the available raw material that can help the firm owner to ask the clients to modify their orders in such a way that the firm makes the full use of its available raw material? \n\nThe answer to this query is given in the following example: \n\nExample 4 Suppose $\\mathrm { \\Delta P _ { 1 } }$ $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ ， $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ are as in Example 2. Let the firm has 330 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ ,455 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and 140 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ available with it and let the amount of raw materials $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ required to manufacture each unit of the three products is given by \n\nHow many units of each product is to be made so as to utilise the fullavailable raw material? \n\nSolution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable. \n\nStep 2 Suppose the firm produces $x$ units of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } , y$ units of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ and $z$ units of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ Since product $\\mathrm { \\mathrm { P } } _ { 1 }$ requires 3 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ ， $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ requires 7 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ requires 5 units of $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ (observe matrix B) and the total number of units, of $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ ,available is 330,we have \n\nSimilarly, we have \n\nand \n\nThis system of equations can be expressed in matrix form as \n\nStep 3 Using elementary row operations, we obtain \n\nThis gives $x = 2 0 , y = 3 5$ and $z = 5$ . Thus, the firm can produce 20 units of $\\mathrm { \\Delta P _ { 1 } } _ { : }$ 35 units of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ and 5 units of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ to make full use of its available raw material. \n\nRemark One may observe that if the manufacturer decides to manufacture according to the available raw material and not according to the purchase orders of the two clients $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ (as in Example 3), he/she is unable to meet these purchase orders as $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ demanded 6 units of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ where as the manufacturer can make only 5 units of $\\mathrm { ~ P ~ } _ { 3 }$ Example 5 A manufacturer of medicines is preparing a production plan of medicines $\\mathbf { M } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ . There are suficient raw materials available to make 2Oooo bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { 1 }$ and 40000 bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ ，but there are only 45oo0 bottles into which either of the medicines can be put. Further, it takes 3 hours to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { 1 }$ , it takes 1 hour to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ and there are 66 hours available for this operation. The profit is Rs 8 per botle for $\\mathbf { M } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ and Rs 7 per bottle for $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ . How should the manufacturer schedule his/her production in order to maximise profit? \n\nSolution Step 1 To find the number of bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ and $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ in order to maximise the profit under the given hypotheses. \n\nStep 2 Let $x$ be the number of bottles of type $\\mathbf { M } _ { 1 }$ medicine and $y$ be the number of bottles of type $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ medicine. Since profit is Rs 8 per bottle for $\\mathbf { M } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ and Rs 7 per bottle for $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 } .$ , therefore the objective function (which is to be maximised) is given by \n\nThe objective function is to be maximised subject to the constraints (Refer Chapter 12 on Linear Programming) \n\nStep 3 The shaded region OPQRST is the feasible region for the constraints (1) (Fig A.2.3). The co-ordinates of vertices O, P, Q, R, S and $\\mathrm { T }$ are (0, 0), (20000, 0), (20000,6000),(10500,34500),(5000,40000) and $( 0 , 4 0 0 0 0 )$ ,respectively. \n\nNote that \n\nZ at $\\mathrm { P } \\left( 0 , 0 \\right) = 0$   \nZ at $\\mathrm { ~ P ~ } ( 2 0 0 0 0 , 0 ) = 8 \\times 2 0 0 0 0 = 1 6 0 0 0 0$   \nZ at $\\mathrm { ~ Q ~ } ( 2 0 0 0 0 , 6 0 0 0 ) = 8 \\times 2 0 0 0 0 + 7 \\times 6 0 0 0 = 2 0 2 0 0 0$ Zat $\\mathrm { ~ R ~ } ( 1 0 5 0 0 , 3 4 5 0 0 ) = 8 \\times 1 0 5 0 0 + 7 \\times 3 4 5 0 0 = 3 2 5 5 0 ($ Zat $\\mathrm { S } = ( 5 0 0 0 , 4 0 0 0 0 ) = 8 \\times 5 0 0 0 + 7 \\times 4 0 0 0 0 = 3 2 0 0 0 0$ Z at $\\mathrm { T } = ( 0 , 4 0 0 0 0 ) = 7 \\times 4 0 0 0 0 = 2 8 0 0 0 0$ \n\nNow observe that the profit is maximum at $x = 1 0 5 0 0$ and $y = 3 4 5 0 0$ and the maximum profit is $\\yen 325500$ .Hence, the manufacturer should produce 105oo bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { \\mathfrak { r } }$ medicine and 34500 bottles of $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 }$ medicine in order to get maximum profit of 325500. \n\nExample 6 Suppose a company plans to produce a new product that incur some costs (fixed and variable) and let the company plans to sell the product at a fixed price. Prepare a mathematical model to examine the profitability. \n\nSolution Step 1 Situation is clearly identifiable. \n\nStep 2 Formulation: We are given that the costs are of two types: fixed and variable. The fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced (e.g.,rent and rates), while the variable costs increase with the number of units produced (e.g., material). Initially, we assume that the variable costs are directly proportional to the number of units produced— this should simplify our model. The company earn a certain amount ofmoney by selling its products and wants to ensure that it is maximum.For convenience, we assume that all units produced are sold immediately. \n\nThe mathematical model \n\nLet \n\nOur assumptions above state that C consists of two parts: \n\n(i)fixed $\\mathtt { c o s t } = a$ (in rupees), (ii)variable $\\textstyle \\cos \\mathrm { t } = b$ (rupees/unit produced). \n\nThen \n\nAlso, income I depends on selling price $s$ (rupees/unit) \n\nThus \n\nThe profit $\\mathrm { P }$ is then the difference between income and costs. So \n\nWe now have a mathematical model of the relationships (1) to (3) between the variables $x ,$ C,I, P, a, b, s. These variables may be classified as: \n\nThe manufacturer, knowing x, a, $^ { b }$ $s$ can determine P. \n\nStep 3 From (3), we can observe that for the break even point (i.e., make neither profit nor loss), he must have $\\mathrm { P } = 0$ ,i.e., $x { = } \\frac { a } { s { - } b }$ units. \n\nSteps 4 and 5 In view of the break even point, one may conclude that if the company produces few units, i.e., less than $x { = } \\frac { a } { s { - } b }$ units ， then the company will suffer loss \n\nand if it produces large number of units, i.e., much more than $\\frac { a } { s - b }$ units, then it can make huge profit.Further, if the break even point proves to be unrealistic, then another model could be tried or the assumptions regarding cash flow may be modified. \n\nRemark From (3), we also have \n\nThis means that rate of change of $\\mathrm { P }$ with respect to $x$ depends on the quantity $s - b$ ,which is the difference of selling price and the variable cost of each product. Thus, in order to gain profit, this should be positive and to get large gains,we need to produce large quantity of the product and at the same time try to reduce the variable cost. 1 \n\nExample 7 Let a tank contains 10oo litres of brine which contains $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of salt per litre. Brine containing $2 0 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of salt per litre flows into the tank at the rate of 25 litres per minute and the mixture flows out at the same rate. Assume that the mixture is kept uniform all the time by stirring. What would be the amount of salt in the tank at any time $t ?$ \n\nSolution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable. \n\n$\\operatorname { s t e p } 2 \\operatorname { L e t } y = y ( t )$ denote the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time $t$ (in minutes) after the inflow, outflow starts. Further assume that $y$ is a differentiable function. \n\nWhen $t = 0$ , i.e., before the inflow-outflow of the brine starts, \n\nNote that the change in $y$ occurs due to the inflow, outflow of the mixture. \n\nNow the inflow of brine brings salt into the tank at the rate of $5 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ per minute (as $2 5 \\times 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g } = 5 \\mathrm { k g }$ and the outflow of brine takes salt out of the tank at the rate of $2 5 { \\left( \\frac { y } { 1 0 0 0 } \\right) } { = } { \\frac { y } { 4 0 } } { \\mathrm { ~ k g } }$ =40kg permite (sattiet,tesaltitais $\\frac { y } { 1 0 0 0 } \\mathrm { k g } )$ \n\nThus,the rate ofchange of salt with respect to $t$ is given by \n\nThis gives a mathematical model for the given problem. \n\nStep 3 Equation (1) is a linear equation and can be easily solved. The solution of(1) is given by \n\nwhere, $c$ is the constant of integration. \n\nNote that when $t = 0 , y = 2 5 0 .$ Therefore, $2 5 0 = 2 0 0 \\div \\mathrm { C }$ \n\nor \n\nThen (2) reduces to \n\nor \n\nor \n\nTherefore \n\nHere,the equation (4) gives the time $t$ at which the salt in tank is $y \\mathrm { k g }$ \n\nStep 4 Since $e ^ { - \\frac { t } { 4 0 } }$ is always positive,from (3), weconclude that $y > 2 0 0$ at all times Thus, the minimum amount of salt content in the tank is $2 0 0 \\mathrm { k g }$ \n\nAlso, from (4), we conclude that $t > 0$ if and only if $0 < y - 2 0 0 < 5 0$ i.e., if and only if $2 0 0 < y < 2 5 0$ i.e., the amount of salt content in the tank after the start of inflow and outflow of the brine is between $2 0 0 \\mathrm { k g }$ and $2 5 0 \\mathrm { k g }$ \n\nLimitations of Mathematical Modelling \n\nTill today many mathematical models have been developed and applied successfully to understand and get an insight into thousands of situations. Some of the subjects like mathematical physics, mathematical economics, operations research, bio-mathematics etc. are almost synonymous with mathematical modelling. \n\nBut there are still a large number of situations which are yet to be modelled. The reason behind this is that either the situation are found to be very complex or the mathematical models formed are mathematically intractable. \n\nThe development of the powerful computers and super computers has enabled us to mathematically model a large number of situations (even complex situations). Due to these fast and advanced computers,it has been possible to prepare more realistic models which can obtain better agreements with observations. \n\nHowever, we do not have good guidelines for choosing various parameters /variables and also for estimating the values of these parameters /variables used in a mathematical model. Infact, we can prepare reasonably accurate models to fit any data by choosing five or six parameters / variables.We require a minimal number of parameters / variables to be able to estimate them accurately. \n\nMathematical modelling of large or complex situations has its own special problems. These type of situations usually occur in the study of world models of environment, oceanography, pollution control etc.Mathematical modellers from all disciplines - mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social sciences, etc., are involved in meeting these challenges with courage. 1",

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). \n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. \n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode offunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children's life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook atempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. \n\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and Mathematics, Professor J.V.Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P.K. Jain for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement. 人 \n\nNew Delhi 20 December 2005 \n\nRationalisation of Content in the Textbook \n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students.The National Education Policy 2O20, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. \n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: \n\nOverlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same   \nclass   \nSimilar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject   \nDifficulty level   \nContent, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions   \nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer  \nlearning   \nContent, which is irrelevant in the present context \n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. \n\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA \n\nPREAMBLE \n\nWE， THE PEOPLE OF INDIA， haVing solemnly resolved to constitute India into a 1[SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC] and to secure to all its citizens : \n\nJUSTICE， social, economic andpolitical;\n\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; \n\nEgUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all \n\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the ²[unity and integrity of the Nationl; \n\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949 do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION. \n\nPreface \n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had constituted 21 Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education, to review the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 200o (NCFSE - 2000) in face of new emerging challenges and transformations occurring in the fields of content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International spectrum of school education. These Focus Groups made general and specific comments in their respective areas. Consequently, based on these reports of Focus Groups, National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed. \n\nNCERT designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development Teams for Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in mathematics under the new guidelines and new syllabi. The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was brought in 2005. \n\nThe first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team consisting of NCERT faculty, experts and practicing teachers. The draft was refined by the development team in different meetings. This draft of the book was exposed to a group of practicing teachers teaching mathematics at higher secondary stage in different parts of the country, in a review workshop organised by the NCERT at Delhi. The teachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated in the draft textbook. The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted out of the development team. Finally, the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics and the Monitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry, Government of India have approved the draft of the textbook. \n\nIn the fitness of things,let us cite some of the essential features dominating the textbook. These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters. The existing textbook contain 13 main chapters and two appendices. Each Chapter contain the followings: \n\n■Introduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier studied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the chapter. Organisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/sub concepts. Motivating and introducing the concepts/sub concepts. Ilustrations have been provided wherever possible. \n\n■Proofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity of approaches wherever possible have been inducted.   \nGeometric viewing/ visualisation of concepts have been emphasised whenever needed. Applications of mathematical concepts have also been integrated with allied subjects like science and social sciences.   \nAdequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section. For refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skill of problem solving and applicabilities,miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been provided involving two or more sub concepts at a time at the end of the chapter. The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected conducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005. For more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been provided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter relevant quotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed significantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided. Lastly, for direct recapitulation of main concepts, formulas and results, brief summary of the chapter has also been provided. \n\nI am thankful to Professor Krishan Kumar, Director, NCERT who constituted the team and invited me to join this national endeavor for the improvement of mathematics education. He has provided us with an enlightened perspective and a very conducive environment. This made the task of preparing the book much more enjoyable and rewarding.I express my gratitude to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics, for his specific suggestions and advice towards the improvement of the book from time to time.I,also, thank Prof. G.

    "content": "Just as a mountaineer climbs a mountain - because it is there, so a good mathematics student studies new material because it is there.- JAMES B.BRISTOL 7 \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nDifferential Calculus is centred on the concept of the derivative.The original motivation for the derivative was the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of functions and calculating the slope of such lines.Integral Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of the functions. \n\nIf a function $f$ is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its derivative $f$ 'exists at each point of I, then a natural question arises that given $f ^ { \\prime }$ at each point of I, can we determine the function? The functions that could possibly have given function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or primitive) of the function.Further, the formula that gives all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in many practical situations. For instance,if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types: \n\n(a）the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given, (b）the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain conditions. \n\nThese two problems lead to the two forms_of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus. \n\nThere is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,between indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability. \n\nIn this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration. \n\n7.2 Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation \n\nIntegration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function, we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive,i.e., the original function. Such a process is called integration or anti differentiation. Let us consider the following examples: \n\nWe know that \n\nand \n\nWe observe that in (1), the function cos $x$ is the derived function of sin $x$ .We say $\\frac { x ^ { 3 } } { 3 }$ that sin $x$ is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos $x$ Similarly, in (2) and (3), and $e ^ { x }$ are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of $x ^ { 2 }$ and $e ^ { x }$ ,respectively. Again, we note that for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows : \n\nThus,anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique. Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers.For this reason C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant. In fact, $\\textrm { C }$ is the parameter by varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function. \n\nMore generall,iftereis functionFctat ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } \\operatorname { F } \\left( x \\right) = f \\left( x \\right) , { \\big \\cdot } \\forall x \\in { \\mathrm { I } } { \\mathrm { ( i n t e r v a l ) } } ,$ then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration) \n\nThus, \n\n$\\{ \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { F } } + \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { C } } , \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { C } } \\in \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } \\}$ denotes a family of anti derivatives of $f$ \n\nRemark Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let $g$ and $h$ be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I. \n\nConsider the function $f = g - h$ defined by $f ( \\boldsymbol { x } ) = g ( \\boldsymbol { x } ) - h ( \\boldsymbol { x } ) , \\forall \\boldsymbol { x } \\in \\mathrm { I }$ \n\nThen \n\nor \n\ni.e., the rate of change of $f$ with respect to $x$ is zero on I and hence $f$ is constant. \n\nIn view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family $\\{ \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { F } } + \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { C } } , \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { C } } \\in \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } \\}$ provides all possible anti derivatives of $f .$ \n\nWe introduce a new symbol, namely, $\\int f ( x ) d x$ which will represent the entire class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of $f$ with respect to $x$ Symbolically, we write $\\int f ( x ) d x = \\mathbf { F } \\left( x \\right) + \\mathbf { C }$ \n\nNotation Given that ${ \\frac { d y } { d x } } = f \\left( x \\right)$ , we write $y = \\int f \\left( x \\right) d x$ \n\nFor the sake of convenience, we mention below the following symbols/terms/phrases with their meanings as given in the Table (7.1). \n\nWe already know the formulae for the derivatives of many important functions. From these formulae,we can write down immediately the corresponding formulae (referred to as standard formulae) for the integrals of these functions,as listed below which will be used to find integrals of other functions. \n\nDerivatives \n\nIntegrals (Anti derivatives) \n\n(i) ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } \\left( { \\frac { x ^ { n + 1 } } { n + 1 } } \\right) = x ^ { n } ~ ;$ $\\int x ^ { n } d x = { \\frac { x ^ { n + 1 } } { n + 1 } } + \\mathbf { C } , n \\neq - 1$ Particularly, we note that $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\frac { d } { d x } ( x ) - 1 ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } ( \\sin x ) = \\cos x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( - \\cos x \\right) = \\sin x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( - \\cos x \\right) = \\sin x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( \\tan x \\right) = \\sin ^ { 2 } x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( - \\cos x \\right) = \\cos ^ { 2 } x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( - \\cos x \\right) = \\cos ^ { 2 } x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( \\cos x \\right) = \\sin ^ { 2 } x ; } \\\\ & { \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( \\cos x \\right) = - \\sin x ; } \\\\ & { d , } \\end{array}$ $\\int d x = x + C$   \n(i) ʃcos x dx = sin x +   \n(m)   \n(iv)   \n(v)   \n(vi) ； [sec x tan x dx = sec x + C   \n(vii) $\\begin{array} { l } { { { \\displaystyle \\frac { d } { d x } ( - \\cos e x ) = \\cos e x \\cos e } } } \\\\ { { { \\displaystyle \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( \\sin ^ { - 1 } x \\right) = \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } \\ ; } } } \\\\ { { { \\displaystyle \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( - \\cos ^ { - 1 } x \\right) = \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } \\ ; } } } \\\\ { { { \\displaystyle \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( \\tan ^ { - 1 } x \\right) = \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } \\ ; } } } \\\\ { { { \\displaystyle \\frac { d } { d x } \\left( e ^ { x } \\right) = e ^ { x } \\ ; } } } \\end{array}$ [cosec x cot x dx = - cosec x + C   \n(vil) $\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\int \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x + \\mathbf { C } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\int \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } = - \\cos ^ { - 1 } x + \\mathbf { C } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\int \\frac { d x } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } = \\tan ^ { - 1 } x + \\mathbf { C } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\int e ^ { x } d x = e ^ { x } + \\mathbf { C } } \\end{array}$   \n(ix)   \n(x）   \n(xi) \n\nNoteIn practice, we normally do not mention the interval over which the various functions are defined. However, in any specific problem one has to keep it in mind. \n\n7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral \n\nIn this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals. \n\n(I）The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the sense of the following results : \n\nand \n\n$\\int f ^ { \\prime } ( x ) d x = f ( x ) + \\mathbf { C }$ , where C is any arbitrary constant. \n\nProof Let F be any anti derivative of $f ,$ i.e., \n\nThen \n\nTherefore \n\nSimilarly, we note that \n\nand hence \n\nwhere C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration. \n\n(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of curves and so they are equivalent. \n\nProof Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions such that \n\nor \n\nHence $\\int f \\left( x \\right) d x - \\int g \\left( x \\right) d x = \\textbf { C }$ where $\\textrm { C }$ is any real number(Why?) \n\nor \n\nSo the families of curves $\\left\\{ \\int f ( x ) d x + \\mathbf { C } _ { 1 } , \\mathbf { C } _ { 1 } \\in \\mathbf { R } \\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{ \\int g ( x ) d x + \\mathbf { C } _ { 2 } , \\mathbf { C } _ { 2 } \\in \\operatorname { R } \\right\\}$ are identical. Hence,in this sense, $\\int f ( x ) d x { \\mathrm { a n d } } \\int g ( x ) d x$ are equivalent. \n\nNoteThe equivalence of the families $\\left\\{ \\int f ( x ) d x + \\mathbf { C } _ { 1 } , \\mathbf { C } _ { 1 } \\in \\mathbf { R } \\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{ \\int g ( x ) d x + \\mathbf { C } _ { 2 } , \\mathbf { C } _ { 2 } \\in \\mathbf { R } \\right\\}$ is customarilyexpresedywring $\\int f ( x ) d x = \\int g ( x ) d x .$ without mentioning the parameter. \n\nProof By Property (I), we have \n\nOn the otherhand, we find that \n\nThus, in view of Property $( \\mathrm { I I } )$ , it follows by (1) and (2） that \n\n(IV）For any real number $k$ ， $\\int k \\ f ( x ) d x = k \\int f ( x ) d x$ \n\nProof By the Property (I), ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } \\int k \\ f ( x ) d x = k \\ f ( x ) .$ \n\nTherefore, using the Property $( \\mathrm { I I } )$ , we have $\\int k \\ f ( x ) d x = k \\int f ( x ) d x .$ \n\n(V） Properties (II) and (IV） can be generalised to a finite number of functions $f _ { 1 } , f _ { 2 } , . . . , f _ { n }$ and the real numbers, $k _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 } , k _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 2 } , . . . , k _ { \\scriptscriptstyle n }$ giving \n\nTo find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function whose derivative is the given function. The search for the requisite function for finding an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it through some examples. \n\nExample 1 Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the method of inspection: \n\n(i) cos 2x 1） 3x²+ 4² () ${ \\frac { 1 } { x } } , x \\neq 0$ \n\nSolution \n\n(i) We look for a function whose derivative is cos $2 x$ Recall that \n\nTherefore, an anti derivative of cos $2 x$ is ${ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } \\sin 2 x$ \n\n(ii) We look for a function whose derivative is $3 x ^ { 2 } + 4 x ^ { 3 }$ . Note that \n\nTherefore, an anti derivative of $3 x ^ { 2 } + 4 x ^ { 3 }$ is $x ^ { 3 } + x ^ { 4 }$ \n\n(i) We know that \n\nCombining above, we get ${ \\frac { d } { d x } } \\left( \\log | x | \\right) = { \\frac { 1 } { x } } , x \\neq 0$ \n\nTherefore, $\\int { \\frac { 1 } { x } } d x = \\log \\left| x \\right|$ is one ftheantidcrvyaivesf $\\frac { 1 } { x }$ \n\nExample 2 Find the following integrals: \n\n$\\int { \\frac { x ^ { 3 } - 1 } { x ^ { 2 } } } d x$ (i) $\\int ( x ^ { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } + 1 ) d x$ (i） ʃ（x²+2e²-）dx x\n\nSolution \n\n(i) We have \n\nNote|From now onwards, we shall write only one constant of integration in the final answer. \n\n(ii) We have \n\nExample 3 Find the following integrals: \n\nSolution \n\n(i)We have $\\int ( \\sin x + \\cos x ) d x = \\int \\sin x d x + \\int \\cos x d x$ epubln   \n(ii) We have ʃ(cosec x (cosec x + cot x)dx=ʃcosec²xdx + ʃcosec x cot xdx C = - cot x-cosec x+C \n\n(ii) We have \n\nExample 4 Find the anti derivative $\\mathrm { F }$ of $f$ defined by $f ( x ) = 4 x ^ { 3 } - 6$ ,where $\\mathrm { F } \\left( 0 \\right) = 3$ Solution One anti derivative of $f ( x )$ is $x ^ { 4 } - 6 x$ since \n\nTherefore, the anti derivative $\\mathrm { F }$ is given by \n\n$\\operatorname { F } ( x ) = x ^ { 4 } - 6 x + \\mathbf { C }$ ，where $\\textrm { C }$ is constant. \n\nGiven that \n\nHence, the required anti derivative is the unique function $\\mathrm { F }$ defined by \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) We see that if F is an anti derivative of $f ,$ then so is $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } + \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ ，where C is any constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative $\\mathrm { F }$ of a function $f ,$ we can write down an infinite number of anti derivatives of $f$ by adding any constant to F expressed by $\\Gamma ( x ) + \\mathbf { C } , \\mathbf { C } \\in \\mathbf { R }$ In applications,it is often necessary to satisfy an additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique anti derivative of the given function.   \n(ii) Sometimes,F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are therefore blocked for finding $\\int f ( x ) d x$ . For example, it is not possible to find $\\int e ^ { - x ^ { 2 } } d x$ by inspection since we can notfindafunction whose derivative is $e ^ { - x ^ { 2 } }$ \n\n(ii) When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than $x$ , the integral formulae are modified accordingly.

It was based on inspection, i.e., on the search of a function F whose derivative is $f$ which led us to the integral of $f .$ However, this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions. Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals by reducing them into standard forms.Prominent among them are methods based on: \n\n1．Integration by Substitution   \n2．Integration using Partial Fractions   \n3．Integration by Parts \n\n7.3.1 Integration by substitution \n\nIn this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution. \n\nThe given integral $\\int f ( x ) d x$ can be transformed into another form bychanging the independent variable $x$ to $t$ by substituting $x = g \\left( t \\right)$ \n\nConsider \n\nPut $x = g ( t )$ so that ${ \\frac { d x } { d t } } = g ^ { \\prime } ( t )$ \n\nWe write \n\nThus \n\nThis change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the name of integration by substitution.It is often important to guess what will be the useful substitution. Usually, we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples. \n\nExample 5 Integrate the following functions w.r.t. x: \n\ni $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { \\sin m x } { \\sqrt { x } \\sec ^ { 2 } { \\sqrt { x } } } }$ (ii) 2x sin (x² + 1) sin (tan-1 x) (m) (iv) 1+ x² \n\nSolution \n\n(i) We know that derivative of mx is $m$ . Thus,we make the substitution $m x = t$ so that $m d x = d t$ re Therefore, $\\int \\sin { m x } d x = { \\frac { 1 } { m } } \\int \\sin { t } d t = - { \\frac { 1 } { m } } \\cos { t } + { \\bf C } = - { \\frac { 1 } { m } } \\cos { m x } + { \\bf C }$   \n(ii) Derivative of $x ^ { 2 } + 1$ is $2 x$ .Thus,we use the substitution $x ^ { 2 } + 1 = t$ so that $2 x d x = d t$ Therefore, $\\int 2 x \\sin ( x ^ { 2 } + 1 ) d x = \\int \\sin t d t \\ = \\ - \\cos t + \\mathbf { C } = - \\cos ( x ^ { 2 } + 1 ) + \\mathbf { C }$   \n(i) Derivtive of $\\sqrt { x }$ is ${ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } x ^ { - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 { \\sqrt { x } } } } .$ .Thus,we use the substitution ${ \\sqrt { x } } = t$ so that ${ \\frac { 1 } { 2 { \\sqrt { x } } } } d x = d t$ giving $d x = 2 t$ dt. Thus, $\\int { \\frac { \\tan ^ { 4 } { \\sqrt { x } } \\sec ^ { 2 } { \\sqrt { x } } } { \\sqrt { x } } } d x = \\int { \\frac { 2 t \\tan ^ { 4 } t \\sec ^ { 2 } t d t } { t } } = 2 \\int \\tan ^ { 4 } t \\sec ^ { 2 } t d t$ Again, we make another substitution tan $t = u$ so that $\\sec ^ { 2 }  t d t = d u$ \n\nTherefore, \n\nHence, \n\nAlternatively, make the substitution tan ${ \\sqrt { x } } = t$ \n\n(iv)Derivative of $\\tan ^ { - 1 } x = { \\frac { 1 } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } }$ 、Thus, we use the substitution \n\nNow, we discuss some important integrals involving trigonometric functions and their standard integrals using substitution technique. These will be used later without reference. \n\nWe have \n\nPut cos $x = t$ so that sin $x d x = - d t$ \n\nThen \n\nor \n\nWe have $\\int \\cot x d x = \\int { \\frac { \\cos x } { \\sin x } } d x$ \n\nPut sin $x = t$ so that cos $x d x = d t$ \n\nWe have \n\nPut sec $x +$ tan $x = t$ so that sec $x$ (tan $x + \\sec x$ ） $d x = d t$ \n\nTherfore, $\\int \\sec { x } d x = \\int { \\frac { d t } { t } } { = } \\log { \\big | } t { \\big | } + \\mathbf { C } = \\log { \\big | } { \\sec { x } } + \\tan { x } { \\big | } + \\mathbf { C }$ \n\nWe have \n\nPut cosec $x +$ cot $x = t$ so that - cosec $x$ (cosec x + cot $x$ ） $d x = d t$ \n\nExample 6 Find the following integrals: \n\n①) ʃsin³ xcos² x dx @ $\\int { \\frac { \\sin x } { \\sin ( x + a ) } } d x \\quad { \\mathrm { ( i i i ) ~ } } \\int { \\frac { 1 } { 1 + \\tan x } } d x$ \n\nSolution \n\n(i) We have $\\begin{array} { c } { \\displaystyle \\int \\sin ^ { 3 } x \\cos ^ { 2 } x d x = \\int \\sin ^ { 2 } x \\cos ^ { 2 } x ( \\sin x ) d x } \\\\ { = \\displaystyle \\int ( 1 - \\cos ^ { 2 } x ) \\cos ^ { 2 } x ( \\sin x ) d x } \\end{array}$ \n\nPut $t = \\cos x$ so that $d t = - \\sin x \\ d x$ \n\n(ii)Put $x + a = t$ .Then $d x = d t$ .Therefore \n\nHence,J $\\int { \\frac { \\sin x } { \\sin ( x + a ) } } d x = x$ cos a - sin a log lsin $( x + a ) | + \\mathbf { C } .$ where, $\\mathbf { C } = - \\mathbf { C } _ { 1 }$ sin $a + a$ cos $a$ , is another arbitrary constant. \n\nNow, consider $\\operatorname { I } = \\int { \\frac { \\cos x - \\sin x } { \\cos x + \\sin x } } d x$ \n\nPut cos $x + \\sin x = t$ so that $( \\cos x - \\sin x ) d x = d t$ \n\nPutting it in (1), we get \n\nEXERCISE 7.2 \n\nIntegrate the functions in Exercises 1 to 37: \n\n2x   \n1 1+x2² \n\n(1og x）² X \n\n1 3. x + x log x \n\n4. sin x sin (cos x) \n\n5. sin $( a x + b )$ cos $( a x + b )$ \n\n6. √ax+b \n\n7.x√x+2 \n\n8.x√1+2x² \n\n9.

Then $d x = a \\sec ^ { 2 } \\theta \\operatorname { d } \\theta$ \n\nTherefore, \n\nApplying these standard formulae, we now obtain some more formulae which are useful from applications point of view and can be applied directly to evaluate other integrals. \n\n(7） To find the integral $\\int { \\frac { d x } { a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c } }$ , we write \n\nNow, put $x + { \\frac { b } { 2 a } } = t$ so that $d x = d t$ and writing ${ \\frac { c } { a } } - { \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a ^ { 2 } } } = \\pm k ^ { 2 }$ . We find the are   \nintegral reduced to the form $\\frac { 1 } { a } \\int \\frac { d t } { t ^ { 2 } \\pm k ^ { 2 } }$ depending upon the sign of $\\left( { \\frac { c } { a } } - { \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a ^ { 2 } } } \\right)$   \nand hence can be evaluated. \n\n(8) To find the integral of the type $\\int { \\frac { \\ d x } { \\sqrt { a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c } } }$ ，proceeding as in (7),we obtain the integral using the standard formulae. \n\n(9) To find the integral of the type $\\int { \\frac { p x + q } { a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c } } d x$ -dx， where p,q, a, b, c are constants, we are to find real numbers A, B such that \n\nTo determine A and B,we equate from both sides the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms.A and B are thus obtained and hence the integral is reduced to one of the known forms. \n\n(10） For the evaluation of the integral of the type $\\int { \\frac { \\left( p x + q \\right) d x } { \\sqrt { a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c } } }$ , we proceed \n\nas in (9) and transform the integral into known standard forms. \n\nLet us illustrate the above methods by some examples. \n\nExample 8 Find the following integrals: \n\n$\\int { \\frac { \\ d x } { x ^ { 2 } - 1 6 } }$ $\\int { \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { 2 x - x ^ { 2 } } } }$ \n\nSolution \n\n(i) We have $\\int { \\frac { d x } { x ^ { 2 } - 1 6 } } = \\int { \\frac { d x } { x ^ { 2 } - 4 ^ { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 1 } { 8 } } \\log \\left| { \\frac { x - 4 } { x + 4 } } \\right| + C \\ [ { \\mathrm { b y ~ } } 7 . 4 \\ ( 1 ) ]$ \n\n$\\int { \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { 2 x - x ^ { 2 } } } } = \\int { \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { 1 - \\left( x - 1 \\right) ^ { 2 } } } }$ \n\nPut $x - 1 = t$ Then $d x = d t$ \n\nTherefore, \n\nExample 9 Find the following integrals : \n\nSolution \n\n(i) We have \n\nLet \n\n$x - 3 = t$ .Then $d x = d t$ \n\n(ii)The given integral is ofthe form 7.4(7).

If the degree of $\\mathrm { P } ( x )$ is less than the degree of $\\mathrm { Q } ( x )$ , then the rational function is called proper, otherwise, it is called improper. The improper rational functions can be reduced to the proper rational functions bylongdivisioproces.usif $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) }$ is improper, then $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) } { = } \\mathrm { T } ( x ) + \\frac { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) } ,$ where $\\mathrm { T } ( x )$ is a polynomial in $x$ and $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) }$ is aproperrationalfunction.As we know how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the integration of a proper rational function. The rational functions which we shall consider here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into linear and quadratic factors. Assume that we want to evaluate $\\int { \\frac { \\mathrm { P } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) } } d x$ dx, where $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) }$ is proper rational function. It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition. After this, the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods. The following Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with various kind of rational functions. 一 \n\nIn the above table,A,B and C are real numbers to be determined suitably. \n\nExample 11 Find $\\int { \\frac { d x } { ( x + 1 ) \\left( x + 2 \\right) } }$ \n\nSolution The integrand is a proper rational function. Therefore, by using the form of partial fraction [Table 7.2 (i)], we write \n\nwhere, real numbers A and B are to be determined suitably. This gives \n\nEquating the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term, we get \n\nand \n\nSolving these equations, we get $\\mathrm { A } { = } 1$ and $\\mathbf { B } = - \\mathbf { \\nabla } 1$ \n\nThus, the integrand is given by \n\nTherefore, \n\nRemark The equation (1) above is an identity,i.e.a statement true for all(permissible) values of $x$ . Some authors use the symbol $\\cdot _ { \\equiv } \\cdot$ to indicate that the statement is an identity and use the symbol $\\cdot _ { = } \\cdot$ to indicate that the statement is an equation, i.e., to indicate that the statement is true only for certain values of $x$ \n\nExample 12 Find $\\int { \\frac { x ^ { 2 } + 1 } { x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 } } d x$ \n\nSolution Here the integrand $\\frac { x ^ { 2 } + 1 } { x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6 }$ is not properrationalfunction,sowedivide $x ^ { 2 } + 1$ by $x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 6$ and find that \n\nLet \n\nSo that \n\nEquating the coefficients of $x$ and constant terms on both sides, we get $\\mathbf { A } + \\mathbf { B } = 5$ and $3 \\mathrm { A } + 2 \\mathrm { B } = 5$ . Solving these equations, we get $\\mathrm { A } = - 5$ and $\\mathrm { B } = 1 0$ \n\nThus, \n\nTherefore, \n\nExample 13 Find $\\int { \\frac { 3 x - 2 } { ( x + 1 ) ^ { 2 } ( x + 3 ) } } d x$ \n\nSolution The integrand is of the type as given in Table 7.2 (4). We write \n\nSo that \n\nComparing coefficient of $x ^ { 2 }$ ， $x$ and constant term on both sides,we get $\\mathbf { A } + \\mathbf { C } = 0$ ， $4 \\mathrm { A } + \\mathrm { B } + 2 \\mathrm { C } = 3$ and $3 \\mathrm { A } + 3 \\mathrm { B } + \\mathrm { C } = - 2$ . Solving these equations, we get \n\n$\\mathbf { A } = { \\frac { 1 1 } { 4 } } , \\mathbf { B } = { \\frac { - 5 } { 2 } }$ and $\\mathbf { C } = \\frac { - 1 1 } { 4 }$ Thus the integrand is given by \n\nTherefore, \n\nExample 14 Find $\\int { \\frac { x ^ { 2 } } { ( x ^ { 2 } + 1 ) \\left( x ^ { 2 } + 4 \\right) } } d x$ \n\nSolution Consider $\\frac { x ^ { 2 } } { ( x ^ { 2 } + 1 ) ( x ^ { 2 } + 4 ) }$ and put $x ^ { 2 } = y$ \n\nThen \n\nWrite \n\nSo that \n\nComparing coeficients of $y$ and constant terms on both sides, we get $\\mathbf { A } + \\mathbf { B } = 1$ and $4 \\mathrm { { A } + \\mathrm { { B } = 0 } }$ , which give \n\nThus, \n\nTherefore, \n\nIn the above example, the substitution was made only for the partial fraction part and not for the integration part. Now, we consider an example, where the integration involves a combination of the substitution method and the partial fraction method. \n\nExample 5 Find $\\int { \\frac { \\left( 3 \\sin \\Phi - 2 \\right) \\cos \\Phi } { 5 - \\cos ^ { 2 } \\Phi - 4 \\sin \\Phi } } d \\Phi$ \n\nSolution Let $y = \\sin \\Phi$ \n\nThen \n\nNow, we write \n\n[by Table 7.2 (2)] \n\nTherefore, \n\nComparing the coefficients of $y$ and constant term, we get $\\mathrm { A } = 3$ and $\\mathrm { B } - 2 \\mathrm { A } = - 2$ ， which gives $\\mathrm { A } = 3$ and $\\mathrm { B } = 4$ \n\nTherefore, the required integral is given by \n\nExample 16 Find $\\int { \\frac { x ^ { 2 } + x + 1 d x } { ( x + 2 ) \\left( x ^ { 2 } + 1 \\right) } }$ \n\nSolution The integrand is a proper rational function. Decompose the rational function into partial fraction [Table 2.2(5)]. Write \n\nTherefore, \n\nEquating the coefficients of $x ^ { 2 } , x$ and of constant term of both sides, we get $\\mathrm { ~ A ~ } + \\mathrm { ~ B ~ } = 1$ ， $2 \\mathbf { B } + \\mathbf { C } = 1$ and $\\mathrm { A } + 2 \\mathrm { C } = 1$ .

Then, by the product rule of differentiation, we have \n\nIntegrating both sides, we get \n\nor \n\nLet \n\nTherefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as \n\ni.e., \n\nIf we take $f$ as the first function and $g$ as the second function, then this formula may be stated as follows: \n\n“The integral of the product of two functions $=$ (first function) $\\times$ (integral of the second function) -Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function) $\\times$ (integral of the second function)]\"\\* \n\nExample 17 Find $\\int x \\cos x d x$ \n\nSolution $\\Pr _ { J } ( x ) = x$ (first function) and $g \\left( x \\right) = \\cos x$ (second function). Then, integration by parts gives 1 \n\nSuppose, we take \n\n$f ( x ) = \\cos { x }$ and $g \\left( x \\right) = x$ .Then \n\nThus, it shows that the integral $\\int x \\cos x d x$ is reduced to the comparatively more complicated integral having more power of $x$ .Therefore, the proper choice of the first function and the second function is significant. \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of functions in all cases.For instance,the method does not work for $\\int { \\sqrt { x } } \\sin x d x$ The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is ${ \\sqrt { x } } \\sin x .$   \n(ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function cos $x$ \n\nas sin $x + k$ ,where $k$ is any constant, then \n\nThis shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of integration by parts. \n\n(iii)Usually,if any function is a power of $x$ or a polynomial in $x$ , then we take it as the first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function. \n\nExample 18 Find $\\int \\log x d x$ \n\nSolution To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is $\\log x .$ We take $\\log x$ as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function. Then, the integral of the second function is $x$ \n\nHence, \n\nExample 19 Find $\\int x e ^ { x } d x$ \n\nSolution Take first function as $x$ and second function as $e ^ { x }$ . The integral of the second function is $e ^ { x }$ \n\nTherefore, \n\n$\\int { \\frac { x \\sin ^ { - 1 } x } { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } } d x$ \n\nSolution Let first function be sin $^ - 1 x$ and second function be $\\frac { x } { { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } }$ \n\nFirst wfindteintegaloftescondfunctio,ie, $\\int { \\frac { x d x } { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } }$ \n\nPut $t = 1 - x ^ { 2 }$ .

The definite integral has a unique value. A definite integralis denoted by $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x$ , where $a$ is called the lower limit of the integral and $^ b$ is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the interval $[ a , b ]$ , then its value is the difference between the values of $\\mathrm { F }$ at the end points,i.e., $\\operatorname { F } ( b ) - \\operatorname { F } ( a )$ · 一 \n\n7.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus \n\n7.8.1 Area function \n\nWe have defined $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x$ as the area of the region bounded by the curve $y = f ( x )$ ， the ordinates $x = a$ and $x = b$ and $x$ -axis. Let $x$ be a given point in $[ a , b ]$ . Then $\\int _ { a } ^ { x } f ( x ) d x$ represents the area of the light shaded region in $\\mathrm { F i g } 7 . 1$ [Here it is assumed that $f ( x ) > 0$ for $x \\in [ a , b ]$ , the assertion made below is equally true for other functions as well]. The area of this shaded region depends upon the value of $x$ \n\nIn other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of $x$ .We denote this function of $x$ by $\\mathbf { A } ( x )$ . We call the function $\\mathbf { A } ( x )$ as Area function and is given by \n\nBased on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given. However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book. \n\n7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus \n\nTheorem 1 Let $f$ be a continuous function on the closed interval $[ a , b ]$ and let A $( x )$ be the area function. Then $\\mathbf { A } ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = f ( x )$ ,for all $x \\in [ a , b ]$ \n\n7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus \n\nWe state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals by making use of anti derivative. \n\nTheorem 2 Let $f$ be continuous function defined on the closed interval $[ a , b ]$ and $\\mathrm { F }$ be an anti derivative of $f .$ Then $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x = [ \\mathbf { F } ( x ) ] _ { a } ^ { b } = \\mathbf { F } \\left( b \\right) - \\mathbf { F } ( a ) .$ \n\nRemarks \n\n(i)）In words,the Theorem 2 tels us that $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x =$ (value of the anti derivative F of $f$ at the upper limit $b -$ value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit $a$ ).   \n(ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.   \n(ii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship between differentiation and integration.   \n(iv）In $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x$ , the function $f$ needs to be welldefined and continuous in $[ a , b ]$ For instance, the consideration of definite integral $\\int _ { - 2 } ^ { 3 } x ( x ^ { 2 } - 1 ) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } d x$ is erroneous Y $f ( x ) = x ( x ^ { 2 } - 1 ) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } }$ since the function $f$ expressed by is not defined in a portion $- \\ : 1 < x < 1$ of the closed interval $[ - 2 , 3 ]$ . Steps for calculating $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x$   \n(i)Findthe indefinite integral $\\int f ( x ) d x$ . Let this be $\\mathrm { F } ( x )$ . There is no need to keep integration constant C because if we consider $\\mathrm { F } ( x ) + \\mathbf { C }$ instead of $\\operatorname { F } ( x )$ , we get $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x = \\left[ \\operatorname { F } \\left( x \\right) + \\operatorname { C } \\right] _ { a } ^ { b } = \\left[ \\operatorname { F } ( b ) + \\operatorname { C } \\right] - \\left[ \\operatorname { F } ( a ) + \\operatorname { C } \\right] = \\operatorname { F } ( b ) - \\operatorname { F } ( a ) .$ Thus,the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite integral.   \n(ii) Evaute $\\ F ( b ) - \\ F ( a ) = \\left[ \\ F \\left( x \\right) \\right] _ { a } ^ { b }$ , whic is te valu of $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x$ We now consider some examples \n\nExample 25 Evaluate the following integrals: \n\nSolution \n\nTherefore, by the second fundamental theorem, we get \n\n(ii) Let $\\operatorname { I } = \\int \\limits _ { 4 } ^ { 9 } { \\frac { \\sqrt { x } } { ( 3 0 - x ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } ) ^ { 2 } } } d x$ . We first find the anti derivative of the integrand. E Put $3 0 - x ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } = t . \\mathrm { T h e n } - { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } { \\sqrt { x } } d x = d t { \\mathrm { o r } } { \\sqrt { x } } d x = - { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } d t$ Thus, $\\int { \\frac { \\sqrt { x } \\ \\left( \\begin{array} { c } { { \\displaystyle \\sqrt { x } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle ( 3 0 - x ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } ) ^ { 2 } } } \\end{array} \\right) d x } { ( 3 0 - x ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } } } d x = - { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } \\int { \\frac { d t } { t ^ { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } \\left[ { \\frac { 1 } { t } } \\right] = { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } \\left[ { \\frac { 1 } { ( 3 0 - x ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } ) } } \\right] = \\operatorname { F } \\left( x \\right)$ \n\nTherefore,by the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we have \n\n(i) Let $\\mathrm { I } = \\int _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } { \\frac { x d x } { \\left( x + 1 \\right) \\left( x + 2 \\right) } }$ \n\nUsing partial fraction, we get $\\frac { x } { \\left( x + 1 \\right) \\left( x + 2 \\right) } { = } \\frac { - 1 } { x + 1 } + \\frac { 2 } { x + 2 }$ \n\nSo \n\nTherefore,by the second fundamental theorem of calculus,we have \n\n(iv)Let=sintdCoiderstdt \n\nPut sin $2 t = u$ so that 2 cos $2 t d t = d u$ or cos $2 t d t = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } { \\stackrel { } { } } d u$ \n\nSo \n\nTherefore, by the second fundamental theorem of integral calculus \n\nEXERCISE 7.8 \n\nEvaluate the definite integrals in Exercises 1 to 20. \n\nChoose the correct answer in Exercises 21 and 22. \n\n21. 1 $\\int _ { 1 } ^ { \\sqrt { 3 } } \\frac { d x } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } }$ equals \n\n(A) $\\frac { \\pi } { 3 }$ (B) $\\frac { 2 \\pi } { 3 }$ (C) 元 (D） π2 \n\n22. $\\int { \\frac { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } { 4 + 9 x ^ { 2 } } }$ equals \n\n(A) (B) (C) (D) \n\n7.9 Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Substitution \n\nIn the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method of substitution. \n\nTo evaluate $\\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x$ , by substitution,the steps could be as follows: \n\n1.

Here, the integral will be kept in the new variable itself,and the limits of the integral willaccordingly be changed, so that we can perform the last step. \n\nLet us illustrate this by examples. \n\nExample 26 Evaluate $\\int { \\overset { 1 } { \\lrcorner } } 5 x ^ { 4 } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 5 } + 1 } } d x$ \n\nSolution Put $t = x ^ { 5 } + 1$ , then $d t = 5 x ^ { 4 } d x$ \n\nTherefore, $\\int 5 x ^ { 4 } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 5 } + 1 } } d x = \\int { \\sqrt { t } } d t = { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } t ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } = { \\frac { 2 } { 3 } } ( { \\ x ^ { 5 } + 1 } ) ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } }$ \n\nHence, \n\nAlternatively,first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral with new limits. \n\nLet \n\nNote that, when \n\nThus,as $x$ varies from $^ Ḋ - 1 Ḍ$ to 1, $t$ varies from 0 to 2 \n\nTherefore \n\n$\\int \\limits _ { 0 } ^ { 1 } \\frac { \\tan ^ { - 1 } x } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } d x$ \n\nSolution Let $t = \\tan ^ { - 1 } x$ ,then $d t = { \\frac { 1 } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } } d x$ The new limits are, when $x = 0$ ， $t = 0$ and when $x = 1 , t = \\frac { \\pi } { 4 }$ Thus, as $x$ varis from 0 t 1, $t$ varis from 0 to0 $\\frac { \\pi } { 4 }$ \n\nTherefore \n\nEXERCISE 7.9 \n\nEvaluate the integrals in Exercises 1 to 8 using substitution. \n\nChoose the correct answer in Exercises 9 and 10. \n\n9.

Then we write $\\int f ( x ) d x = \\mathbf { F } \\left( x \\right) + \\mathbf { C }$ . These integrals are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of integration. All these integrals differ by a constant. \n\nSome properties of indefinite integrals are as follows: \n\n2.

If degree of the polynomial $\\mathrm { P } \\left( x \\right)$ is greater than the degree of the polynomial $\\mathrm { Q } \\left( x \\right)$ , then we may divide $\\mathrm { P } \\left( x \\right)$ by $\\mathrm { Q } \\left( x \\right)$ so that $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) } { = \\mathrm { T } \\left( x \\right) + \\frac { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) } }$ where $\\mathrm { T } ( x )$ is a polynomial in $x$ and degree of $\\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x )$ is less than the degree of $\\mathrm { Q } ( x ) . \\mathrm { T } ( x )$ being polynomial can beeasily integrated. $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) }$ can be integrated by expressing $\\frac { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x ) } { \\mathrm { Q } ( x ) }$ as hsofas \n\nwhere $x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ can not be factorised further. \n\nIntegration by substitution \n\nA change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the fundamental integrals. The method in which we change the variable to some other variable is called the method of substitution. When the integrand involves some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the integrals. Using substitution technique, we obtain the following standard integrals. \n\nIntegrals of some special functions \n\n${ \\int { \\frac { d x } { { x } ^ { 2 } - a ^ { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 a } } \\mathrm { l o g } \\left| { \\frac { x - a } { x + a } } \\right| + \\mathbf { C } }$ (ii) $\\int { \\frac { d x } { a ^ { 2 } - x ^ { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 a } } \\mathrm { l o g } \\left| { \\frac { a + x } { a - x } } \\right| + \\mathbf { C }$ $\\int { \\frac { d x } { x ^ { 2 } + a ^ { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 1 } { a } } \\tan ^ { - 1 } { \\frac { x } { a } } + \\mathbf { C }$ $\\int \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { { x ^ { 2 } - a } ^ { 2 } } } = \\log \\left| x + \\sqrt { { x ^ { 2 } - a } ^ { 2 } } \\right| + C \\left( \\mathrm { v } \\right) \\ \\int \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { { a ^ { 2 } - x } ^ { 2 } } } = \\sin ^ { - 1 } \\frac { x } { a } + C$ $\\int { \\frac { d x } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + a ^ { 2 } } } } = \\log \\mid x + { \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + a ^ { 2 } } } \\mid + \\mathbf { C }$ \n\nIntegration by parts \n\nFor given functions $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ , we have $\\int f _ { 1 } ( x ) \\cdot f _ { 2 } ( x ) d x = f _ { 1 } ( x ) \\int f _ { 2 } ( x ) d x - \\int \\left[ { \\frac { d } { d x } } f _ { 1 } ( x ) \\cdot \\int f _ { 2 } ( x ) d x \\right] d x ~ ,$ i.e. he integral of the product of two functions $=$ first function $\\times$ integral of the second function - integral of {differential coefficient of the first function $\\times$ integral of the second function}. Care must be taken in choosing the first function and the second function.

The formulae of elementary geometry allow us to calculate areas of many simple figures. However, they are inadequate for calculating the areas enclosed by curves. For that we shall need some concepts of Integral Calculus. \n\nIn the previous chapter, we have studied to find the area bounded by the curve $y = f ( x )$ , the ordinates $x = a$ ， $x = b$ and $x$ -axis, while calculating definite integral as the limit of a sum.Here, in this chapter, we shall study a specific application of integrals to find the area under simple curves, area between lines and arcs of circles,parabolas and ellipses (standard forms only). We shall also deal with finding the area bounded by the above said curves. \n\n8.2 Area under Simple Curves \n\nIn the previous chapter, we have studied definite integral as the limit of a sum and how to evaluate definite integral using Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now, we consider the easy and intuitive way of finding the area bounded by the curve $y = f ( \\bar { x } )$ ， $x$ -axis and the ordinates $x = a$ and $x = b$ . From $\\mathrm { F i g ~ 8 . 1 }$ ,we can think of area under the curve as composed of large number of very thin vertical strips. Consider an arbitrary strip of height $y$ and width $d x$ ， then $d \\mathrm { A }$ (area of the elementary strip $) = y d x$ ， where, $y = f ( x )$ \n\nA.L. Cauchy (1789-1857) \n\nThis area is called the elementary area which is located at an arbitrary position within the region which is specified by some value of $x$ between $a$ and $^ b$ . We can think of the total area A of the region between $x$ -axis,ordinates $x = a$ ， $x = b$ and the curve $y = f ( x )$ as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region \n\nPQRSP. Symbolically, we express \n\nThe area A of the region bounded by the curve $x = g \\left( y \\right)$ ， $y$ -axis and the lines $y \\ = \\ c$ ， $y = d$ is given by \n\nHere, we consider horizontal strips as shown in the Fig 8.2 Remark If the position of the curve under consideration is below the $x$ -axis, then since $f ( x ) < 0$ from $x = a$ to $x = b$ , as shown in $\\operatorname { F i g } 8 . 3$ , the area bounded by the curve, $x$ -axis and the ordinates $x = a$ ， $x = b$ come out to be negative. But, it is only the numerical value of the area which is taken into consideration. Thus, if the area is negative, we take isabsolute value,i.e, $\\left| \\int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) d x \\right| .$ \n\nGenerally, it may happen that some portion of the curve is above $x$ -axis and some is below the $x$ -axis as shown in the Fig 8.4. Here, $\\mathrm { A } _ { 1 } < 0$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } > 0$ . Therefore, the area A bounded by the curve $y = f \\left( x \\right)$ ， $x$ -axis and the ordinates $x = a$ and $x = b$ is given by $\\mathrm { A } = | \\mathrm { A } _ { 1 } | + \\mathrm { A } _ { 2 }$ \n\nExample 1 Find the area enclosed by the circle $x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } = a ^ { 2 }$ . \n\nSolution From Fig 8.5, the whole area enclosed by the given circle \n\n$= 4$ (area of the region AOBA bounded by the curve, $x$ -axisand the ordinates $x = 0$ and $x = a$ ）[as the circle is symmetrical about both $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis] \n\nAs the region AOBA lies in the first quadrant, $y$ is taken as positive. Integrating, we get the whole area enclosed by the given circle \n\nAlternatively, considering horizontal strips as shown in Fig 8.6, the whole area of the region enclosed by circle \n\nExample 2 Find the area enclosed by the ellipse ${ \\frac { x ^ { 2 } } { a ^ { 2 } } } + { \\frac { y ^ { 2 } } { b ^ { 2 } } } = 1$ \n\nSolution From $\\mathrm { F i g } 8 . 7$ , the area of the region ABA'B'A bounded by the ellipse =4 ( area of theregion AOBAinthe firstquadrantbounded ) by the curve,x - axis and the ordinates $\\scriptstyle x = 0 , x = a$ (as the ellipse is symmetrical about both $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis) $= 4 \\int _ { 0 } ^ { a } y d x$ (taking veticalstrips) \n\nNow ${ \\frac { x ^ { 2 } } { a ^ { 2 } } } + { \\frac { y ^ { 2 } } { b ^ { 2 } } } = 1$ gives s $y = \\pm { \\frac { b } { a } } { \\sqrt { a ^ { 2 } - x ^ { 2 } } }$ , but as the region AOBA lies in the first quadrant, $y$ is taken as positive.

This method arose in the solution of problems on calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies etc. In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early method of integration. The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early period was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes (300 B.C.) \n\nSystematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century. In 1665,Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory of fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at any point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function called the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents. \n\nDuring 1684-86,Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum which he called Calculas summatorius, since it was connected with the summation of a number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ' In 1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to Calculus integrali. This corresponded to Newton's inverse method of tangents. \n\nBoth Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which was radically different. However, respective theories accomplished results that were practically identical. Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is quite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative and the definite integral. \n\nConclusively, the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and primarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work of P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G. Leibnitz at the end of 17th century. However, this justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L. Cauchy in the early 19th century. Lastly, it is worth mentioning the following quotation by Lie Sophie's: \n\n“It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which in their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the investigations of Kepler,Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis... The discovery that differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton and Leibnitz\".",

HILBERT \n\n9.1 Introduction \n\nIn Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book,we discussed how to differentiate a given function fwith respect to an independent variable,i.e.,how to find $f ^ { \\prime } ( x )$ for a given function $f$ at each $x$ in its domain of definition. Further, in the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find a function $f$ whose derivative is the function $g$ , which may also be formulated as follows: \n\nFor a given function $g$ , find a function $f$ such that \n\nAn equation of the form (1) is known as a differential equation. A formal definition will be given later. \n\nThese equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Anthropology, Geology, Economics etc.Hence,an indepth study of differential equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations. \n\nIn this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation, general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and some applications of differential equations in different areas. \n\n9.2 Basic Concepts \n\nWe are already familiar with the equations of the type: \n\nLet us consider the equation: \n\nWe see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable (variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as wellas derivative of the dependent variable $y$ with respect to the independent variable $x$ ，Such an equation is called a differential equation. \n\nIn general,an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation. \n\nA differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g., \n\n$2 { \\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } } } + \\left( { \\frac { d y } { d x } } \\right) ^ { 3 } = 0$ is an ordinary differential equation \n\nOf course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to more than one independent variables,called partial differential equations but at this stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only. Now onward, we will use the term‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential equation'. \n\n' Note \n\n1. We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives: \n\n2. For derivatives of higher order,it willbe inconvenient to use so many dashes as supersuffix therefore, we use the notation $y _ { n }$ for $n$ th order derivative $\\frac { d ^ { n } y } { d x ^ { n } }$ \n\n9.2.1. Order of a differential equation \n\nOrder of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation. \n\nConsider the following differential equations: \n\nThe equations (6),(7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and third order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are 1,2 and 3 respectively. \n\n9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation \n\nTo study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives,i.e., $y ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime \\prime \\prime }$ etc. Consider the following differential equations: \n\nWe observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in $y ^ { \\prime \\prime \\prime }$ ， $y ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ and $y ^ { \\prime }$ , equation (10) is a polynomial equation in $y ^ { \\prime }$ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential equations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in $y ^ { \\prime }$ and degree of such a differential equation can not be defined. \n\nBy the degree of a differential equation,when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives,we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved in the given differential equation. \n\nIn view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7), (8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (1O) is of degree two while the degree of differential equation (11) is not defined. \n\nNote Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always positive integers. \n\nExample $\\mathbf { 1 }$ Find the order and degree, if defined, of each of the following differential equations: \n\nSolution \n\n$\\frac { d y } { d x }$ so its orderis one.Itisapolynmalequtionin $y ^ { \\prime }$ and he highest powerraised to $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ is one, so its degree is one. $\\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } }$ ,s0 E its order is two. It is a polynomial equation $\\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } }$ and $\\frac { d y } { d x }$ and the highest power raised to $\\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } }$ is one, so its degree is one. 一   \n(iii) The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is $y ^ { \\dprime \\prime }$ ，so its order is three. The given differential equation is not a polynomial equation in its derivatives and so its degree is not defined. \n\nEXERCISE 9.1 \n\nDetermine order and degree (if defined) of differential equations given in Exercises 1 to 10. \n\n1. $ , \\frac { d ^ { 4 } y } { d x ^ { 4 } } + \\sin ( y ^ { \\prime \\prime } ) = 0 2 , { } y ^ { \\prime } + 5 y = 0 3 . \\left( \\frac { d s } { d t } \\right) ^ { 4 } + 3 s \\frac { d ^ { 2 } s } { d t ^ { 2 } } = 0$   \n$\\begin{array} { l l l } { \\displaystyle } & { \\displaystyle } & { \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\cos \\left( \\frac { d y } { d x } \\right) = 0 } \\\\ & { \\displaystyle } & { \\displaystyle } \\\\ { \\displaystyle } & { \\displaystyle } & { \\displaystyle \\left( y ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\right) ^ { 2 } + ( y ^ { \\prime \\prime } ) ^ { 3 } + ( y ^ { \\prime } ) ^ { 4 } + y ^ { 5 } = 0 } \\end{array}$ 5. ${ \\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } } } = \\cos 3 x + \\sin 3 x$   \n6 $\\ : \\ : y ^ { \\prime \\prime } + 2 y ^ { \\prime \\prime } + y ^ { \\prime } = 0 \\ :$ \n\n11． The degree of the differential equation \n\n(A)3 (B)2 (C）1 (D） not defined\n\n12．The order of the differential equation \n\n(A)2 (B)1 (C)0 (D） not defined\n\n9.3. General and Particular Solutions of a Differential Equation \n\nIn earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type: \n\nSolution of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the given equation i.e., when that number is substituted for the unknown $x$ in the given equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to the R.H.S.. \n\nNow consider the differential equation ${ \\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } } } + y = 0$ \n\nIn contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a function $\\boldsymbol { \\Phi }$ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function $\\boldsymbol { \\Phi }$ is substituted for the unknown y (dependent variable) in the given differential equation,L.H.S.becomes equal to R.H.S.. \n\nThe curve $y = \\phi \\left( x \\right)$ is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given differential equation. Consider the function given by \n\nwhere $a$ ， $b \\in \\textbf { R }$ .When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3), $\\mathrm { L . H } . S . = \\mathrm { R } . \\mathrm { H } . S$ . So it is a solution of the differential equation (3). \n\nLet $a$ and $^ b$ be given some prticular ales ay $a = 2$ and $b = \\frac { \\pi } { 4 }$ ,then we get a \n\nfunction \n\nWhen this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3） again $\\mathrm { L . H } . S . = \\mathrm { R . H } . S .$ . Therefore $\\Phi _ { 1 }$ is also a solution of equation (3). \n\nFunction $\\boldsymbol { \\Phi }$ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) $a$ ， $^ b$ and it is called general solution of the given differential equation. Whereas function $\\Phi _ { 1 }$ contains no arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters $a$ and $^ b$ and hence is called a particular solution of the given differential equation. \n\nThe solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation. \n\nThe solution free from arbitrary constants i.e.,the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution of the differential equation. \n\nExample 2 Verify that the function $y = e ^ { - 3 x }$ is a solution of the differential equation \n\nSolution Given function is $y = e ^ { - 3 x }$ . Differentiating both sides of equation with respect to $x$ ,we get \n\nNow, differentiating （1） with respect to $x$ ,we have \n\nSubstuting he aues of ${ \\frac { d ^ { 2 } y } { d x ^ { 2 } } } , { \\frac { d y } { d x } }$ and $y$ intheiveilt $\\mathrm { L .

The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is called a general solution and the solution free from arbitrary constants is called particular solution. \n\nVariable separable method is used to solve such an equation in which variables can be separated completely i.e. terms containing $y$ should remain with dy and terms containing $x$ should remain with $d x$ \n\nA differential equation which can be expressed in the form ${ \\frac { d y } { d x } } = f \\left( x , y \\right) $ or ${ \\frac { d x } { d y } } = g ( x , y )$ where, $f ( x , y )$ and $g ( x , y )$ are homogenous functions of degree zero is called a homogeneous differential equation. \n\nA differential equation of the form ${ \\frac { d y } { d x } } + \\mathrm { P y } = \\mathrm { Q }$ , where P and Qare constants or functions of $x$ only is called a first order linear differential equation. \n\nHistorical Note \n\nOne of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations. Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November, 11,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black and white the identity $\\int y \\ d y = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } y ^ { 2 }$ , thereby introducing both the symbols Jand dy. Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents were prescribed. This led him to discover the ‘method of separation ofvariables' 1691. A year later he formulated the ‘method of solving the homogeneous differential equations of the first order'.He went further in a very short time to the discovery of the ‘method of solving a linear differential equation of the first-order'. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man and that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations! \n\nIn the old days, what we now callthe ‘solution' of a differential equation, was used to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred years since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare (1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution' and thus the word ‘solution' has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of the‘method of separation of variables’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748), a younger brother of James Bernoulli. \n\nApplication to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations. In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the differential equation \n\nwhich led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of cubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking differential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of differential equations, under the heading ‘qualitative analysis of differential equations'. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely necessary in almost all investigations.",

    "content": "VECTOR ALGEBRA \n\nIn most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what one has established another undoes. In Mathematics alone each generation builds a new story to the old structure. - HERMAN HANKEL ： \n\n10.1 Introduction \n\nIn our day to day life,we come across many queries such as - What is your height? How should a football player hit the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters, a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars. However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and direction (in which another player is positioned). Such quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and engineering, we frequently come across with both types of quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length,mass, time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work, money, voltage, density,resistance etc.and vector quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc. \n\nIn this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various operations on vectors,and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors, and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above. \n\n10.2 Some Basic Concepts \n\nLet $\\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\ast } l ^ { \\ast }$ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given two directions by means of arrowheads.A line with one of these directions prescribed is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (i). \n\nNow observe that if we restrict the line $l$ to the line segment AB, then a magnitude is prescribed on the line $l$ with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed line segment (Fig 1O.1(ii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as direction. → \n\nDefinition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector. \n\nNotice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 1O.1(iii)), denoted as $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ or simply as $\\vec { a }$ , and read as‘vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ or‘vector $\\vec { a }$ \n\nThe point A from where the vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ starts is called its initial point, and the point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as $| \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } } |$ ,or $| \\vec { a } |$ ,or $a$ . The arrow indicates the direction of the vector. \n\nNote Since the length is never negative, the notation $| \\vec { a } | < 0$ has no meaning. \n\nPosition Vector \n\nFrom Class XI, recallthe three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system (Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point $\\mathrm { P }$ in space, having coordinates $( x , y , z )$ with respect to the origin ${ \\mathrm { O } } ( 0 , 0 , 0 )$ . Then, the vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O P } }$ having O and $\\mathrm { P }$ as its initial and terminal points,respectively, is called the position vector of the point $\\mathrm { P }$ with respect to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of $\\overline { { \\mathrm { O P } } }$ (or $\\vec { r }$ )is given by \n\nIn practice, the position vectors of points A,B,C, etc., with respect to the origin O are denoted by $\\vec { a }$ $, \\vec { b } , \\vec { c }$ ,etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)). \n\nDirection Cosines \n\nConsider the position vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O P } } ( \\mathrm { o r } \\overrightarrow { r } )$ of a point $\\mathrm { P } ( x , y , z )$ as in Fig 10.3. The angles $\\alpha$ $\\beta , \\gamma$ made by the vector $\\vec { r }$ with the positive directions of $x$ ， $y$ and $z$ -axes respectively, are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles,i.e., cos $\\alpha$ ,cos $\\beta$ and cos $\\gamma$ are called direction cosines of the vector $\\vec { r }$ , and usually denoted by $l$ m and $n$ ， resnectivelv \n\nFrom $\\mathrm { F i g } 1 0 . 3$ , one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled,and in it, we have cos $\\alpha = \\frac { x } { r }$ $r$ stands for $| { \\vec { r } } |$ ). Similarly,from the right angled triangles OBP and OCP, we may wite cos $\\beta = \\frac { y } { r }$ and cos $\\scriptstyle \\gamma = { \\frac { z } { r } }$ sts also be expressed as (lr, mr,nr). The numbers $l r$ ,mr and nr, proportional to the direction cosines are called as direction ratios of vector $\\vec { r }$ , and denoted as $a , b$ and $c$ ,respectively. \n\nNote One may note that $l ^ { 2 } + m ^ { 2 } + n ^ { 2 } = 1$ but $a ^ { 2 } + b ^ { 2 } + c ^ { 2 } \\neq 1$ , in general. \n\n10.3 Types of Vectors \n\nZero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide,is called a zero vector (or null vector),and denoted as O. Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction as it has zero magnitude. Or,alternatively otherwise,it may be regarded as having any direction. The vectors AA,BB represent the zero vector, \n\nUnit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e.,1 unit) is called a unit vector. The unit vector in the direction of a given vector $\\vec { a }$ is denoted by $\\hat { a }$ . \n\nCoinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial vectors. \n\nCollinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions. \n\nEqual Vectors Two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are said to be equal, if they have the same magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points,and written as ${ \\vec { a } } = { \\vec { b } }$ . \n\nNegative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector (say, AB), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector. For example, vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { B A } }$ is negative of the vector AB,and written as ${ \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { B A } } } = - { \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } } }$ \n\nRemark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are called free vectors.Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only. \n\nExample 1 Represent graphically a displacement of $4 0 \\mathrm { k m }$ ， $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ west of south. \n\nSolution The vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O P } }$ represents the required displacement $( \\mathrm { F i g 1 0 . 4 } )$ \n\nExample 2 Classify the following measures as scalars and vectors. \n\n(i) 5 seconds (ii) $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ \n\n(i) 10 Newton (iv） 30 km/hr (v） 10 g/cm³(vi) $2 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s }$ towards north\n\nSolution \n\n(i) Time-scalar (ii) Volume-scalar (iii) Force-vector(iv) Speed-scalar (v） Density-scalar (vi） Velocity-vector\n\nExample 3 In Fig 10.5, which of the vectors are: \n\n(i) Collinear (ii) Equal (imi) Coinitial \n\nSolution \n\n(i) Collinear vectors : ä, $\\vec { c }$ and $\\vec { d }$ Scale (ii) Equal vectors : $\\vec { a }$ and c. 1unit (iii) Coinitial vectors : $\\vec { b }$ ， $\\vec { c }$ and d. \n\nEXERCISE 10.1 \n\n1． Represent graphically a displacement of $4 0 \\mathrm { k m }$ ， $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ east of north. \n\n2.

Fig 10.6   \n(ii) Two vectors having same magnitude are collinear.   \n(iv） Two collinear vectors having the same magnitude are equal. \n\n10.4 Addition of Vectors \n\nA vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ simply means the displacement from a point A to the point B.Now consider a situation that a girl moves from A to B and then from B to C $( \\mathrm { F i g ~ 1 0 . 7 } )$ . The net displacement made by the girl from point A to the point C, is given by the vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A C } }$ and expressed as \n\nThis is known as the triangle law of vector addition. \n\nIn general, if we have two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b } ( \\mathrm { F i g } 1 0 . 8 ( \\mathrm { i } )$ ), then to add them,they are positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other (Fig 10.8(ii)). \n\nFor example,in Fig 10.8 (i), we have shifted vector $\\vec { b }$ without changing its magnitude and direction, so that it's initial point coincides with the terminal point of $\\vec { a }$ . Then, the vector ${ \\vec { a } } + { \\vec { b } }$ ,represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or resultant) of the vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have \n\nNow again, since ${ \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A C } } } = - { \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { C A } } }$ ,from the above equation, we have \n\nThis means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 1O.8(ii)). \n\nNow, construct a vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { B C ^ { \\prime } } }$ so that its magnitude is same as the vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { B C } }$ , but the direction opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (ii), i.e., \n\nThen, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (ii), we have \n\nThe vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A C ^ { \\prime } } }$ is said to represent the diffrence of $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ \n\nNow, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity vectors-one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity.To have a precise idea about the effective speed and direction (i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have the following law of vector addition. 1 \n\nIf we have two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ represented by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram in magnitude and direction $( \\mathrm { F i g } 1 0 . 9 )$ , then their sum $\\vec { a } + \\vec { b }$ is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram through their common point. This is known as the parallelogram law of vector addition. \n\nNoteFrom Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that \n\nor \n\n(since ${ \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A C } } } = { \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O B } } }$ ）\n\nwhich is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector addition are equivalent to each other. \n\nProperties of vector addition \n\nProperty 1 For any two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ ， \n\n(Commutative property) \n\nProof Consider the parallelogram ABCD (Fig 10.10). Let $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } } = \\overrightarrow { a }$ and $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { B C } } = \\vec { b }$ ,then using the triangle law, from triangle ABC,we have \n\nNow,since the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel, from Fig10.10，wehave, $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A D } } = \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { B C } } = \\overrightarrow { b }$ and $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { D C } } = \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } } = \\overrightarrow { a }$ . Again using triangle law, from triangle ADC, we have \n\nHence \n\nProperty 2 For any three vectors $a , b$ and $c$ \n\n(Associative property) \n\nProof Let the vectors $\\vec { a } , \\vec { b }$ and $\\vec { c }$ be represented by PQ, QR and RS, respectively, as shown in Fig 10.11(i) and (i). \n\nThen \n\nand \n\nSo \n\nand \n\nHence \n\nRemark The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of three vectors $\\vec { a } , \\vec { b } , \\vec { c }$ as $\\vec { a } + \\vec { b } + \\vec { c }$ without using brackets. \n\nNote that for any vector $a$ , we have \n\nHere, the zero vector $\\vec { 0 }$ is called the additive identity for the vector addition. \n\n10.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar \n\nLet $\\vec { a }$ be a given vector and $\\lambda$ a scalar. Then the product of the vector $\\vec { a }$ by the scalar $\\lambda$ ,denoted as $\\lambda \\vec { a }$ , is called the multiplication of vector $\\vec { a }$ by the scalar $\\lambda$ . Note that, $\\lambda \\vec { a }$ is also a vector, collinear to the vector $\\vec { a }$ . The vector $\\lambda \\vec { a }$ has the direction same (or opposite) to that of vector $\\vec { a }$ according as the value of $\\lambda$ is positive (or negative). Also, the magnitude of vector $\\lambda \\vec { a }$ is $| \\lambda |$ times the magnitude of the vector $\\vec { a }$ ,i.e., \n\nA geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given \n\nWhen $\\lambda = - 1$ ，then $\\lambda { \\vec { a } } = - \\lambda$ , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the magnitude of $\\vec { a }$ and direction opposite to that of the direction of $\\vec { a }$ . The vector $- \\vec { a }$ is called the negative (or additive inverse) of vector $\\vec { a }$ and we always have \n\nAlso, if $\\lambda = \\frac { 1 } { \\mid a \\mid }$ , provided $\\vec { a } \\neq 0$ i.e. $\\vec { a }$ is not a null vector, then \n\nSo, λ a represents the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec { a }$ . We write it as \n\nNoteFor any scalar $k$ ， $k { \\vec { 0 } } = { \\vec { 0 } }$ \n\n10.5.1 Components of a vector \n\nLet us take the points A(1, O, O), B(O, 1, O) and $\\mathbf { C } ( 0 , 0 , 1 )$ on the $x$ -axis, $y$ -axis and z-axis, respectively. Then, clearly \n\nThe vectors $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O A } }$ ， $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O B } }$ and $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O C } }$ ,each having magnitude 1, are called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ, respectively, and denoted by $i , \\hat { j }$ and $\\hat { k }$ ，respectively (Fig 10.13). 一 \n\nNow, consider the position vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O P } }$ of a point $\\mathrm { P } ( x , y , z )$ Fig 10.13 as in Fig 10.14. Let $\\mathrm { \\mathrm { P } } _ { 1 }$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $\\mathrm { P }$ on the plane XOY. \n\nWe, thus, see that $\\mathrm { { P } } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { { P } }$ is parallel to $z$ -axis. As $i , \\hat { j }$ and $\\hat { k }$ are the unit vectors along the $x , y$ and $z$ -axes, respectively,and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { P _ { 1 } } \\mathrm { P } } = \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O R } } = z \\hat { k }$ Similarly, $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { Q P _ { 1 } } } = \\overline { { \\mathrm { O S } } } = y \\hat { j }$ and $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O Q } } = x \\hat { i }$ \n\nTherefore, it follows that \n\nand \n\nHence, the position vector of $\\mathrm { P }$ with reference to $\\mathrm { o }$ is given by \n\nThis form of any vector is called its component form. Here, $x , y$ and $z$ are called as the scalar components of $\\vec { r }$ and $x \\hat { i }$ ，yj and $z \\hat { k }$ are called the vector components of $\\vec { r }$ along the respective axes. Sometimes $x , y$ and $z$ are also termed as rectangular components. \n\nThe length of any vector $\\vec { r } = x \\hat { i } + y \\hat { j } + z \\hat { k }$ , is readily determined by applying the Pythagoras theorem twice. We note that in the right angle triangle $\\mathrm { O Q P _ { 1 } } ( \\mathrm { F i g ~ 1 0 . 1 4 } )$ \n\nand in the right angle triangle ${ \\mathrm { O P } } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { P } ;$ we have \n\nHence, the length ofany vector $\\vec { r } = x \\hat { i } + y \\hat { j } + z \\hat { k }$ is given by \n\nIf $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are any two vectors given in the component form $a _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + a _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + a _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ and $b _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + b _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + b _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ ,respectively, then \n\n(i) the sum (or resultant)of the vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ is given by \n\n(ii） the difference of the vector $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ is given by \n\n(ii) the vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are equal if and only if \n\n(iv）the multiplication of vector $\\vec { a }$ by any scalar $\\lambda$ is given by \n\nThe addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar together give the following distributive laws: \n\nLet $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ be any two vectors, and $k$ and $m$ be any scalars. Then \n\n() i $\\begin{array} { l } { { k \\vec { a } + m \\vec { a } = ( k + m ) \\vec { a } } } \\\\ { { k ( m \\vec { a } ) = ( k m ) \\vec { a } } } \\\\ { { k ( \\vec { a } + \\vec { b } ) = k \\vec { a } + k \\vec { b } } } \\end{array}$ \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) One may observe that whatever be the value of $\\lambda$ , the vector $\\lambda \\vec { a }$ is always collinear to the vector $\\vec { a }$ . In fact, two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are collinear if and only if there exists a nonzero scalar $\\lambda$ such that $\\vec { b } = \\lambda \\vec { a }$ . If the vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are given in the component form, i.e. $\\vec { a } = a _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + a _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + a _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ and $\\vec { b } = b _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + b _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + b _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ , then the two vectors are collinear if and only if 1 \n\n(iIf $\\vec { a } = a _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + a _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + a _ { 3 } \\hat { k } .$ then $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } , a _ { 3 }$ are also called directionratios of $\\vec { a }$ (ii) In case ifit is given that $l , m , n$ are direction cosines of a vector, then $l \\hat { i } + m \\hat { j } + n \\hat { k }$ $= ( \\cos \\alpha ) \\hat { i } + ( \\cos \\beta ) \\hat { j } + ( \\cos \\gamma ) \\hat { k }$ is the unit vector in the direction of that vector, where $\\alpha$ ， $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the angles which the vector makes with $x , y$ and $z$ axes respectively. \n\nExample 4 Find the values of $x , y$ and z so that the vectors $\\vec { a } = x \\hat { i } + 2 \\hat { j } + z \\hat { k }$ and $\\vec { b } = 2 \\hat { i } + y \\hat { j } + \\hat { k }$ are equal. \n\nSolution Note that two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal. Thus, the given vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ will be equal if and only if \n\nExample 5 Let $\\vec { a } = \\hat { i } + 2 \\hat { j }$ and $\\vec { b } = 2 \\hat { i } + \\hat { j }$ .Is $| \\vec { a } | = | \\vec { b } | ?$ Are the vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ equal? \n\nSolution We have $\\mid \\vec { a } \\mid = \\sqrt { 1 ^ { 2 } + 2 ^ { 2 } } = \\sqrt { 5 } { \\mathrm { ~ a n d ~ } } \\mid \\vec { \\mathrm { b } } \\mid = \\sqrt { 2 ^ { 2 } + 1 ^ { 2 } } = \\sqrt { 5 }$ \n\nSo, $| \\vec { a } | = | \\vec { b } |$ . But, the two vectors are not equal since their corresponding components are distinct. \n\nExample 6 Find unit vector in the direction of vector $\\vec { a } = 2 \\hat { i } + 3 \\hat { j } + \\hat { k }$ \n\nSolution The unit vector in the direction of a vector $\\vec { a }$ is given by $\\hat { a } = \\frac { 1 } { \\vert \\vec { a } \\vert } \\vec { a }$ \n\nNow \n\nTherefore \n\nExample 7 Find a vector in the direction of vector $\\vec { a } = \\hat { i } - 2 \\hat { j }$ that has magnitude 7 units. \n\nSolution The unit vector in the direction of the given vector $\\vec { a }$ is \n\nTherefore, the vector having magnitude equal to 7 and in the direction of $\\vec { a }$ is \n\nExample $\\mathbf { 8 }$ Find the unit vector in the direction of the sum of the vectors, $\\vec { a } = 2 \\hat { i } + 2 \\hat { j } - 5 \\hat { k }$ and $\\Vec { b } = 2 \\hat { i } + \\hat { j } + 3 \\hat { k }$ \n\nSolution The sum of the given vectors is \n\nand \n\nThus, the required unit vector is \n\nExample 9 Write the direction ratio's of the vector $\\vec { a } = \\hat { i } + \\hat { j } - 2 \\hat { k }$ and hence calculate its direction cosines. \n\nSolution Note that the direction ratio's $a , b , c$ of a vector $\\vec { r } = x \\hat { i } + y \\hat { j } + z \\hat { k }$ are just the respective components $x , y$ and $z$ of the vector. So, for the given vector, we have $a = 1 , b = 1$ and $c = - 2$ . Further, if $l , m$ and $n$ are the direction cosines of the given vector, then \n\n$\\left( \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 6 } } , \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 6 } } , - \\frac { 2 } { \\sqrt { 6 } } \\right)$ \n\n10.5.2 Vector joining two points \n\nIf $\\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } ( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } , z _ { 1 } )$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 } ( x _ { 2 } , y _ { 2 } , z _ { 2 } )$ are any two points, then the vector joining $\\mathrm { \\mathrm { P _ { 1 } } }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ is the vector $\\overline { { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 } } }$ (Fig 10.15). \n\nJoining the points $\\mathrm { P _ { \\ell _ { 1 } } }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ with the origin O, and applying triangle law, from the triangle $\\mathrm { O P } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ ，we have \n\nUsing the properties of vector addition, the above equation becomes \n\ni.e. \n\nThe magnitude of vector $\\overline { { \\mathrm { P } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 } } }$ is given by \n\nExample 10 Find the vector joining the points P(2, 3, O) and $\\mathrm { Q } ( - 1 , - 2 , - 4 )$ directed from P to Q. \n\nSolution Since the vector is to be directed from $\\mathrm { P }$ to Q, clearly $\\mathrm { P }$ is the initial point and Q is the terminal point. So, the required vector joining $\\mathrm { P }$ and $\\mathrm { Q }$ is the vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { P Q } }$ ， given by \n\ni.e. \n\n10.5.3 Section formula \n\nLet Pand Qbe two points represented by the position vectors $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O P } }$ and $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O Q } }$ respectively, with respect to the origin O. Then the line segment joining the points Pand Qmay be divided by a third point, say R, in two ways - internally (Fig 10.16) and externally (Fig 10.17). Here, we intend to find the position vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { O R } }$ for the point R with respect to the origin O. We take the two cases one by one. \n\nCase I When R divides PQ internally (Fig 10.16). \n\nIf R divides $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { P Q } }$ such that n $\\overset \\vartriangle { n \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { R Q } } } = \\overset { \\vartriangle } { \\boldsymbol { n } \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { P R } } }$ ，\n\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are positive scalars, we say that the point R divides $\\overline { { \\mathrm { P Q } } }$ internally in the ratio of $m : n$ . Now from triangles ORQ and OPR, we have \n\nand \n\nTherefore, we have \n\nor \n\n(on simplification) \n\nHence,the position vector of the point R which divides $\\mathrm { P }$ and Q internally in the ratio of $m : n$ is given by \n\nCase II When R divides PQ externally $( \\mathrm { F i g ~ 1 0 . 1 7 } )$ We leave it to the reader as an exercise to verify that the position vector of the point R which divides the line segment PQ externally in the ratio $m : n$ i.e. ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { P R } } { \\mathrm { Q R } } } = { \\frac { m } { n } }$ is given by \n\nRemark If R is the midpoint of $\\mathrm { P Q }$ ，then $m = n$ .

We may recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a matrix. But in case of functions,we may multiply them in two ways, namely, multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly, multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot) product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross） product where the result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section, we will discuss these two types of products. \n\n10.6.1 Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors \n\nDefinition 2 The scalar product of two nonzero vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ ,denoted by $\\vec { a } \\cdot \\vec { b }$ ,is \n\ndefined as $\\vec { a } \\cdot \\vec { b } = \\left| \\vec { a } | \\right| \\vec { b } \\left| \\cos \\Theta , \\right.$ where,0 is the angle between $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ $, 0 \\le { \\Theta } \\le { \\pi }$ (Fig 10.19). If either $\\vec { a } = 0$ or $\\stackrel {  } { b } = 0$ then θ is not defined, and in this case, we define ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\vec { b } } = 0$ \n\nObservations \n\n1. $\\vec { a } \\cdot \\vec { b }$ is a real number.   \n2. Let $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ be two nonzero vectors, then ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\vec { b } } = 0$ if and only if $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are perpendicular to each other.i.e. $\\vec { a } \\cdot \\vec { b } = 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\vec { a } \\perp \\vec { b }$   \n3.If $\\theta = 0$ ,then ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\vec { b } } = \\left| { \\vec { a } } \\right| \\left| { \\vec { b } } \\right|$ ublished ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\vec { a } } = \\mid { \\vec { a } } \\mid ^ { 2 }$   \n4.If $\\theta = \\pi$ ,then $\\vec { a } \\cdot \\vec { b } = - | \\vec { a } | | \\vec { b } |$ Er In particular, ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\vec { b } } = - | { \\vec { a } } | | { \\vec { b } } |$ , as O in this case is π.   \n5.In view of the Observations 2 and 3, for mutually perpendicular unit vectors $\\hat { i } , \\hat { j }$ and $\\hat { k }$ we have \n\n6.The angle between two nonzero vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ is given by \n\n7. The scalar product is commutative. i.e. \n\nTwo important properties of scalar product \n\nProperty 1 (Distributivity of scalar product over addition) Let ${ \\vec { a } } , { \\vec { b } }$ and $\\vec { c }$ be any three vectors, then \n\nProperty 2 Let $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ be any two vectors,and l be any scalar. Then \n\nIf two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ are given in component form as $a _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + a _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + a _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ and $b _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + b _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + b _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ , then their scalar product is given as \n\nThus \n\n10.6.2 Projection of a vector on a line \n\nSuppose a vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ makes an angle $\\theta$ with a given directed line $l$ (say), in the anticlockwise direction $( \\mathrm { F i g ~ } 1 0 . 2 0 )$ . Then the projection of $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ on $l$ is a vector $\\vec { p }$ (say) with magnitude $| \\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } } | \\ | \\cos \\theta | ,$ and the direction of $\\vec { p }$ being the same (or opposite) to that of the line $l$ ,depending upon whether cos O is positive or negative. The vector $\\vec { p }$ is called the projection vector,and its magnitude $| \\vec { p } |$ is simply called as the projection of the vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ on the directed line $l$ \n\nFor example, in each of the following figures (Fig 10.2O(i) to (iv)), projection vector of $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ along the line $l$ is vector $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A C } }$ \n\nObservations \n\n1.If $\\hat { p }$ is the unit vector along a line $l$ , then the projection of a vector $\\vec { a }$ on the line $l$ is given by ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\hat { p } }$ · \n\n2.Projection of a vector $\\vec { a }$ on other vector $\\vec { b }$ , is given by \n\n3.If $\\theta = 0$ , then the projection vector of $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ will be $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ itself and if $\\theta = \\pi$ ,then the projection vector of $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ will be BA. \n\n4.If0= $\\Theta = \\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ or $\\Theta = \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 }$ , then the projection vector of $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A B } }$ will be zero vector. \n\nRemark If $\\alpha$ ， $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the direction angles of vector $\\vec { a } = a _ { 1 } \\hat { i } + a _ { 2 } \\hat { j } + a _ { 3 } \\hat { k }$ , then its direction cosines may be given as \n\nAlso, note that $| \\vec { a } | \\cos \\alpha , | \\vec { a } | \\cos \\beta$ and $| \\vec { a } | \\mathrm { c o s } \\gamma$ are respectively the projections of $\\vec { a }$ along OX, OY and OZ. i.e., the scalar components $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 }$ and $a _ { _ 3 }$ of the vector $\\vec { a }$ ,are precisely the projections of $\\vec { a }$ along $x$ -axis, $y$ -axis and $z$ -axis,respectively.Further, if $\\vec { a }$ is a unit vector, then it may be expressed in terms of its direction cosines as \n\nExample 13 Find the angle between two vectors $\\vec { a }$ and $\\vec { b }$ with magnitudes 1 and 2 respectively and when ${ \\vec { a } } \\cdot { \\vec { b } } = 1$ \n\nSolution Given $\\vec { a } \\cdot \\vec { b } = 1 , | \\vec { a } | = 1$ and $\\vert \\vec { b } \\vert = 2$ .

The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800 when Caspar Wessel(1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand(1768-1822) described that how a complex number $a + i b$ could be given a geometric interpretation with the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton (1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a directed line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton's method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as: $a + b \\hat { i } + c \\hat { j } + d \\hat { k } , \\hat { i } , \\hat { j } , \\hat { k }$ following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by ading them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst (\"Principles of the Art of Weighing\"), which caused a major breakthrough in the development of mechanics.But it took another 200 years for the general concept of vectors to form. \n\nIn the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925),an English engineer,created what we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar) \n\npart of quaternion from its imaginary (vector) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs printed a treatise entitled Element of Vector Analysis. This book gave a systematic and concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G. Tait (1831-1901) who contributed significantly to this subject.",

    "content": "THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY \n\n: The moving power of mathematical invention is not reasoning but imagination. - A.DEMORGAN \n\n11.1 Introduction \n\nIn Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two dimensions,and the introduction to three dimensional geometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some basic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra to three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the study simple and elegant\\*. \n\nIn this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space under different conditions, angle between two lines, two planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two skew lines and distance of a point from a plane.Most of the above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless,we shall also translate these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric and analytic picture of the situation. \n\n11.2 Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line \n\nFrom Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line $\\mathrm { L }$ passing through the origin makes angles $\\alpha$ ， $\\beta$ and γ with $x , y$ and $z$ -axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine of these angles, namely, cos $\\alpha$ cos $\\beta$ and cos $\\gamma$ are called direction cosines of the directed line L. \n\nIf we reverse the direction ofL,then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements, i.e., $\\pi - \\alpha , \\pi - \\beta$ and $\\pi - \\gamma$ . Thus,the signs of the direction cosines are reversed. \n\nNote that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it has two sets of direction cosines. In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for a given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique direction cosines are denoted by l, m and n. \n\nRemark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find its direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line. Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two parallel line have same set of direction cosines. \n\nAny three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are called the direction ratios of the line. If $l$ ,m, $n$ are direction cosines and $a , b$ ， $c$ are direction ratios of a line, then $a = \\lambda l$ ， ${ \\boldsymbol { b } } { = } \\lambda m$ and $c = \\lambda n$ , for any nonzero $\\lambda \\in \\mathbf { R }$ \n\nNoteSome authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers. \n\nLet a, b, $c$ be direction ratios of a line and let $l , m$ and $n$ be the direction cosines (d.c's) of the line. Then \n\nTherefore But Therefore \n\nor \n\nHence, from (1), the d.c. ${ \\bf \\chi } _ { s }$ of the line are \n\nwhere,depending on the desired sign of $k$ , either a positive or a negative sign is to be taken for $l , m$ and $n$ \n\nFor any line, if $a$ ， $^ b$ ， $c$ are direction ratios of a line, then ka, $k b$ ， $k c$ ； $k \\neq 0$ is also a set of direction ratios. So,any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional. Also,for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios. \n\n11.2.1 Direction cosines of a line passing through two points \n\nSince one and only one line passes through two given points,we can determine the direction cosines of a line passing through the given points $\\mathrm { P } ( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } , z _ { 1 } )$ and $\\mathrm { Q } ( x _ { 2 } , y _ { 2 } , z _ { 2 } )$ as follows (Fig 11.2 (a)). \n\nLet $l$ m, $n$ be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles $\\alpha$ ， $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ with the $x$ ， $y$ and $z$ -axis, respectively. \n\nDraw perpendiculars from $\\mathrm { P }$ and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a perpendicular from Pto QS to meet at N. Now, in right angle triangle PNQ, $\\angle \\mathrm { P Q N } = \\gamma$ (Fig 11.2 (b). \n\nTherefore, $\\cos \\gamma = { \\frac { \\mathrm { N Q } } { \\mathrm { P Q } } } = { \\frac { z _ { 2 } - z _ { 1 } } { \\mathrm { P Q } } }$ \n\nSimilarly \n\nHence,the direction cosines of the line segment joining the points $\\mathrm { P } ( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } , z _ { 1 } )$ and $Q ( x _ { _ 2 } , y _ { _ 2 } , z _ { _ 2 } )$ are \n\nwhere \n\nNoteThe direction ratios ofthe line segment joining $\\mathrm { P } ( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } , z _ { 1 } )$ and $\\mathrm { Q } ( x _ { 2 } , y _ { 2 } , z _ { 2 } )$ may be taken as \n\nExample $\\mathbf { 1 }$ If a line makes angle $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ with the positive direction of $x , y$ and z-axis respectively, find its direction cosines. \n\nSolution Let the $d . c . ^ { \\prime } s$ of the lines be $l$ ， $m , n$ . Then $l = \\cos 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } = 0$ ,m=cos $6 0 ^ { \\circ } = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } }$ \n\nExample 2 If a line has direction ratios $2 , - 1 , - 2$ ,determine its direction cosines. \n\nSolution Direction cosines are \n\nor \n\nExample 3 Find the direction cosines of the line passing through the two points $( - 2 , 4 , - 5 )$ and (1, 2, 3). \n\nSolution We know the direction cosines of the line passing through two points $\\mathrm { P } ( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } , z _ { 1 } )$ and $Q ( x _ { _ 2 } , y _ { _ 2 } , z _ { _ 2 } )$ are given by \n\nwhere \n\nHere $\\mathrm { P }$ is $( - 2 , 4 , - 5 )$ and $\\mathrm { Q }$ is (1, 2, 3). \n\nSo \n\nThus, the direction cosines of the line joining two points is \n\nExample 4 Find the direction cosines of $x , y$ and $z$ -axis. \n\nSolution The $x$ -axis makes angles $0 ^ { \\circ }$ $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ respectively with $x , y$ and $z$ -axis.   \nTherefore, the direction cosines of $x$ -axis are cos $0 ^ { \\circ }$ ,cos $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ,cos $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ i.e., 1,0,0.   \nSimilarly, direction cosines of $y$ -axis and $z$ -axis are $0 , 1 , 0$ and 0, 0, 1 respectively. \n\nExample 5 Show that the points A(2, 3, - 4), B(1, - 2, 3) and C (3,8,- 11) are collinear. \n\nSolution Direction ratios of line joining A and B are \n\n$1 - 2 , - 2 - 3 , 3 + 4 \\mathrm { i . e . , } - 1 , - 5 , 7 .$ \n\nThe direction ratios of line joining B and C are \n\n$3 - 1 , 8 + 2 , - 1 1 - 3$ ,i.e.,2,10,-14. \n\nIt is clear that direction ratios ofAB and BC are proportional, hence,AB is parallel to BC.But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A,B, C are collinear points. \n\nEXERCISE 11.1 \n\n1． If a line makes angles $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $1 3 5 ^ { \\circ }$ $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ with the x, y and z-axes respectively, find its direction cosines.   \n2.

Let $l$ be the line which passes through the point A and is parallel to a given vector $\\vec { b }$ .Let $\\vec { r }$ be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the line (Fig 11.3). \n\nThen $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { A P } }$ is parallel to the vector $\\vec { b }$ ,i.e., $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { A P } } = \\lambda \\stackrel { \\vartriangle } { b }$ ，where $\\lambda$ is some real number. \n\nBut i.e. \n\nConversely, for each value of the parameter $\\lambda$ ,this equation gives the position vector of a point $\\mathrm { P }$ on the line.Hence, the vector equation of the line is given by \n\nRemark If $\\vec { b } = a \\hat { i } + b \\hat { j } + c \\hat { k }$ , then $a , b , c$ are direction ratios of the line and conversely, if $a , b .$ $c$ are direction ratios of a line, then $\\vec { b } = a \\hat { i } + b \\hat { j } + c \\hat { k }$ will be the parallel to the line. Here, $^ b$ should not be confused with $| \\vec { b } |$ ■ \n\nDerivation of cartesian form from vector form \n\nLet the coordinates of the given point A be $( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } , z _ { 1 } )$ and the direction ratios of the line be $a , b , c$ . Consider the coordinates of any point P be $( x , y , z )$ . Then \n\nand \n\nSubstituting these values in (1)and equating the coefficients of $i , \\ \\hat { j }$ and $\\hat { k }$ , we get \n\nThese are parametric equations of the line.Eliminating the parameter $\\lambda$ from (2), we get \n\nThis is the Cartesian equation of the line. \n\nNote If l, m, n are the direction cosines of the line, the equation of the line is \n\nExample 6 Find the vector and the Cartesian equations of the line through the point (5,2,- 4) and which is parallel to the vector $3 \\hat { i } + 2 \\hat { j } - 8 \\hat { k }$ \n\nSolution We have \n\nTherefore, the vector equation of the line is \n\nNow, $\\vec { r }$ is the position vector of any point $\\mathrm { P } ( x , y , z )$ on the line. \n\nEliminating $\\lambda$ , we get \n\nwhich is the equation of the line in Cartesian form. \n\n11.4 Angle between Two Lines \n\nLet $\\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ be two lines passing through the origin and with direction ratios $a _ { _ 1 }$ ， $b _ { _ 1 }$ ， $c _ { 1 }$ and $a _ { _ 2 }$ $\\iota _ { _ 2 } , b _ { _ 2 } , c _ { _ 2 } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ ~ } }$ ， respectively. Let P be a point on $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and Q be a point on $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ . Consider the directed lines OP and OQ as given in Fig 11.6.Let 0 be the acute angle between OP and OQ. Now recall that the directed line segments OP and OQ are vectors with components $a _ { _ 1 } , b _ { _ 1 } , c _ { _ 1 }$ and $a _ { _ 2 } , b _ { _ 2 } , c _ { _ 2 } ,$ respectively. Therefore, the angle 0 between them is given by \n\nThe angle between the lines in terms of sin 0 is given by \n\nNote In case the lines $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ do not pass through the origin, we may take lines $\\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } ^ { \\prime }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ^ { \\prime }$ which are parallel to $\\mathrm { L } _ { _ 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { _ 2 }$ respectively and pass through the origin. \n\nIf instead of direction ratios for the lines $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ , direction cosines, namely, $l _ { 1 } , m _ { 1 } , n _ { 1 }$ for $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $l _ { 2 } , m _ { 2 } , n _ { 2 } \\mathrm { f o r } \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ are given, then (1) and (2) takes the following form: \n\nand \n\nTwo lines with direction ratios $a _ { _ 1 } , b _ { _ 1 } , c _ { _ 1 }$ and $a _ { _ 2 } , b _ { _ 2 } , c _ { _ 2 }$ are \n\n(i)perpendicular i.e. if $\\theta = 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ by (1) \n\n(ii)parallel i.e. if $\\theta = 0$ by (2) \n\nNow, we find the angle between two lines when their equations are given. If 0 is acute the angle between the lines \n\nthen \n\nIn Cartesian form, if 0 is the angle between the lines \n\nand \n\nwhere, $a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 } , b _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 , } c _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ and $a _ { _ 2 } b _ { _ 2 }$ , $c _ { 2 }$ are the direction ratios of the lines (1) and (2),respectively, then \n\nExample 7 Find the angle between the pair of lines given by \n\nand \n\nSolution Here $\\vec { b } _ { 1 } = \\hat { i } + 2 \\hat { j } + 2 \\hat { k }$ and $\\vec { b } _ { 2 } = 3 \\hat { i } + 2 \\hat { j } + 6 \\hat { k }$ \n\nThe angle 0 between the two lines is given by \n\nHence \n\nExample 8 Find the angle between the pair of lines \n\nand \n\nSolution The direction ratios of the first line are 3, 5, 4 and the direction ratios of the second line are 1,1,2. If 0 is the angle between them, then \n\n$\\cos ^ { - 1 } \\left( { \\frac { 8 \\sqrt { 3 } } { 1 5 } } \\right)$ \n\n11.5 Shortest Distance between Two Lines \n\nIf two lines in space intersect at a point, then the shortest distance between them is zero. Also, if two lines in space are parallel, then the shortest distance between them will be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the length of the perpendicular drawn from a point on one line onto the other line. \n\nFurther, ina space,there are lines which are neither intersecting nor parallel.In fact, such pair of lines are non coplanar and are called skew lines. For example, let us consider a room of size 1, 3,2 units along $x , y$ and $z$ -axes respectively Fig 11.5. \n\nThe line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through one corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall. These lines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet. \n\nBy the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line with one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the smallest. \n\nFor skew lines,the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both the lines. \n\n11.5.1 Distance between two skew lines \n\nWe now determine the shortest distance between two skew lines in the following way: Let $l _ { 1 }$ and $l _ { 2 }$ be two skew lines with equations (Fig. 11.6) \n\nand \n\nTake any point S on $l _ { 1 }$ with position vector $\\vec { \\bf a } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { T }$ on $l _ { 2 } ,$ with position vector $\\vec { \\bf a } _ { 2 }$ \n\nThen the magnitude of the shortest distance vector will be equal to that of the projection of ST along the direction of the line of shortest distance (See 10.6.2). \n\nf $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { P Q } }$ is the shortest distance vector between l and $l _ { 2 }$ , then it being perpendicular to both $\\vec { b } _ { 1 }$ and $\\vec { b } _ { 2 }$ ， the unit vector $\\hat { n }$ along $\\overrightarrow { \\mathrm { P Q } }$ would therefore be \n\nThen \n\nwhere, $d$ is the magnitude of the shortest distance vector.

POLYA \n\n12.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier classes,we have discussed systems of linear equations and their applications in day to day problems. In Class XI, we have studied linear inequalities and systems of linear inequalities in two variables and their solutions by graphical method. Many applications in mathematics involve systems of inequalities/equations. In this chapter, we shall apply the systems of linear inequalities/equations to solve some real life problems of the type as given below: \n\nA furniture dealer deals in only two items-tables and chairs. He has Rs 50,0O to invest and has storage space of at most 6O pieces.A table costs Rs 250O and a chair Rs 500. He estimates that from the sale of one table, he can make a profit of Rs 25O and that from the sale of one chair a profit of Rs 75.He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy from the available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all the items which he buys. \n\nSuch type of problems which seek to maximise (or, minimise) profit (or, cost) form a general class of problems called optimisation problems.Thus,an optimisation problem may involve finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or minimum use of resources etc. \n\nA special but a very important class of optimisation problems is linear programming problem. The above stated optimisation problem is an example of linear programming problem. Linear programming problems are of much interest because of their wide applicability in industry, commerce, management science etc. \n\nIn this chapter, we shallstudy some linear programming problems and their solutions by graphical method only, though there are many other methods also to solve such problems. \n\n12.2 Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation \n\nWe begin our discussion with the above example of furniture dealer which will further lead to a mathematical formulation of the problem in two variables. In this example, we observe \n\n(i)The dealer can invest his money in buying tables or chairs or combination thereof. Further he would earn different profits by following different investment strategies.   \n(ii) There are certain overriding conditions or constraints viz.,his investment is limited to a maximum of Rs 50,OoO and so is his storage space which is for a maximum of 60 pieces. \n\nSuppose he decides to buy tables only and no chairs, so he can buy $5 0 0 0 0 \\div 2 5 0 0$ i.e., 20 tables. His profit in this case will be Rs $( 2 5 0 \\times 2 0 )$ , i.e., Rs 5000. \n\nSuppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables.With his capital of Rs 50,000, he can buy $5 0 0 0 0 \\div 5 0 0$ ,i.e.100 chairs.But he can store only 6O pieces.Therefore, he is forced to buy only 6O chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs $( 6 0 \\times 7 5 )$ ,i.e., Rs 4500. \n\nThere are many other possibilities,for instance,he may choose to buy 1O tables and 5O chairs,as he can store only 6O pieces.Total profit in this case would be Rs $( 1 0 \\times 2 5 0 + 5 0 \\times 7 5 )$ ,i.e., $\\mathbf { R } \\mathbf { s } \\ 6 2 5 \\mathbf { 0 }$ and so on. \n\nWe, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in different ways and he would earn different profits by following different investment strategies. \n\nNow the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum profit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically. \n\n12.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem \n\nLet $x$ be the number of tables and $y$ be the number of chairs that the dealer buys. Obviously, $x$ and $y$ must be non-negative, i.e., \n\nThe dealer is constrained by the maximum amount he can invest (Here it is Rs 50,OoO) and by the maximum number of items he can store (Here it is 60). \n\nStated mathematically, \n\nor \n\nand \n\nThe dealer wants to invest in such a way so as to maximise his profit, say, Z which stated as a function of $x$ and $y$ is given by \n\n$Z = 2 5 0 x + 7 5 y$ (called objective function) \n\nMathematically, the given problems now reduces to: \n\nMaximise $Z = 2 5 0 x + 7 5 y$ \n\nsubject to the constraints: \n\nSo, we have to maximise the linear function Z subject to certain conditions determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. There are also some other problems where we have to minimise a linear function subject to certain conditions determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. Such problems are called Linear Programming Problems. \n\nThus,a Linear Programming Problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal value (maximum or minimum value) of a linear function (called objective function) of several variables (say $x$ and y), subject to the conditions that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints). The term linear implies that all the mathematical relations used in the problem are linear relations while the term programming refers to the method of determining a particular programme or plan of action. \n\nBefore we proceed further, we now formally define some terms (which have been used above) which we shall be using in the linear programming problems: \n\nObjective function Linear function $\\boldsymbol { Z } = \\boldsymbol { a } \\boldsymbol { x } + \\boldsymbol { b } \\boldsymbol { y }$ , where $a$ ， $^ b$ are constants, which has to be maximised or minimized is called a linear objective function. \n\nIn the above example, $Z = 2 5 0 x + 7 5$ y is a linear objective function. Variables $x$ and $y$ are called decision variables. \n\nConstraints The linear inequalities or equations or restrictions on the variables of a linear programming problem are called constraints. The conditions $x \\geq 0$ ， $y \\ge 0$ are called non-negative restrictions.In the above example, the set of inequalities (1) to (4) are constraints. \n\nOptimisation problem A problem which seeks to maximise or minimise a linear function (say of two variables $x$ and $y$ ） subject to certain constraints as determined by a set of linear inequalities is called an optimisation problem. Linear programming problems are special type of optimisation problems. The above problem of investing a given sum by the dealer in purchasing chairs and tables is an example of an optimisation problem as well as of a linear programming problem. \n\nWe will now discuss how to find solutions to a linear programming problem. In this chapter, we will be concerned only with the graphical method. \n\n12.2.2 Graphical method of solving linear programming problems \n\nIn Class XI, we have learnt how to graph a system of linear inequalities involving two variables $x$ and $y$ and to find its solutions graphically.Let us refer to the problem of investment in tables and chairs discussed in Section 12.2.We will now solve this problem graphically. Let us graph the constraints stated as linear inequalities: \n\nThe graph of this system (shaded region) consists of the points common to all half planes determined by the inequalities (1) to (4) $( \\mathrm { F i g } \\ 1 2 . 1 )$ . Each point in this region represents a feasible choice open to the dealer for investing in tables and chairs. The region, therefore, is called the feasible region for the problem. Every point of this region is called a feasible solution to the problem. Thus, we have, \n\nFeasible region The common region determined by all the constraints including non-negative constraints $x$ $y \\ge 0$ of a linear programming problem is called the feasible region (or solution region) for the problem. In Fig 12.1, the region OABC (shaded) is the feasible region for the problem. The region other than feasible region is called an \n\ninfeasible region. \n\nFeasible solutions Points within and on the boundary of the feasible region represent feasible solutions of the constraints.In Fig 12.1, every point within and on the boundary of the feasible region OABC represents feasible solution to the problem. For example, the point (10, 50) is a feasible solution of the problem and so are the points (0, 60), (20,0) etc. \n\nAny point outside the feasible region is called an infeasible solution. For example, the point (25, 40) is an infeasible solution of the problem. \n\nOptimal (feasible) solution: Any point in the feasible region that gives the optimal value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function is called an optimal solution. \n\nNow, we see that every point in the feasible region OABC satisfies all the constraints as given in (1) to (4),and since there are infinitely many points,it is not evident how we should go about finding a point that gives a maximum value of the objective function $Z = 2 5 0 x + 7 5 y$ ，To handle this situation,we use the following theorems which are fundamental in solving linear programming problems. The proofs of these theorems are beyond the scope of the book. \n\nTheorem 1 Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming problem and let $\\boldsymbol { Z } = \\boldsymbol { a } \\boldsymbol { x } + \\boldsymbol { b } \\boldsymbol { y }$ be the objective function. When Z has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), where the variables $x$ and $y$ are subject to constraints described by linear inequalities, this optimal value must occur at a corner point\\* (vertex) of the feasible region. \n\nTheorem 2 Let R be the feasible region for a linear programming problem, and let $\\boldsymbol { Z } = \\boldsymbol { a } \\boldsymbol { x } + \\boldsymbol { b } \\boldsymbol { y }$ be the objective function. If R is bounded\\*\\*, then the objective function Z has both a maximum and a minimum value on R and each of these occurs at a corner point (vertex) of R. 一 \n\nRemark If R is unbounded, then a maximum or a minimum value of the objective function may not exist. However, if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R. (By Theorem 1). \n\nIn the above example,the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region are: O,A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as $( 0 , 0 )$ ,(20, 0), (10,50) and (0, 60) respectively. Let us now compute the values of $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { Z } }$ at these points. \n\nWe observe that the maximum profit to the dealer results from the investment strategy (10, 50),i.e.buying 10 tables and 50 chairs. \n\nThis method of solving linear programming problem is referred as Corner Point Method. The method comprises of the following steps: \n\n1. Find the feasible region of the linear programming problem and determine its corner points (vertices) either by inspection or by solving the two equations of the lines intersecting at that point.   \n2. Evaluate the objective function $\\boldsymbol { Z } = \\boldsymbol { a } \\boldsymbol { x } + \\boldsymbol { b } \\boldsymbol { y }$ at each corner point. Let M and m, respectively denote the largest and smallest values of these points.   \n3.(i) When the feasible region is bounded, M and m are the maximum and (ii) In case, the feasible region is unbounded, we have: minimum values of Z. hei   \n4.(a) $\\mathbf { M }$ is the maximum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by $a x + b y > \\mathbf { M }$ has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z has no maximum value. (b) Similarly, $m$ is the minimum value of Z,if the open half plane determined by $a x + b y < m$ has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z has no minimum value. \n\nWe will now illustrate these steps of Corner Point Method by considering some examples: \n\nExample 1 Solve the following linear programming problem graphically: \n\nMaximise ${ Z = 4 x + y }$ subject to the constraints: \n\nSolution The shaded region in Fig 12.2 is the feasible region determined by the system of constraints (2) to (4).We observe that the feasible region OABC is bounded. So, we now use Corner Point Method to determine the maximum value of $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { Z } }$ \n\nThe coordinates of the corner points O,A,B and C are $( 0 , 0 )$ , (30,0), (20,30) and (0, 50) respectively. Now we evaluate Z at each corner point. \n\nHence, maximum value of Z is 120 at the point (30, 0). \n\nExample $^ 2$ Solve the following linear programming problem graphically: \n\nMinimise $Z = 2 0 0 x + 5 0 0 y$ \n\nsubject to the constraints: \n\nSolution The shaded region in Fig 12.3 is the feasible region ABC determined by the system of constraints (2) to (4), which is bounded. The coordinates of corner points \n\nA, B and C are (0,5), (4,3) and (0,6) respectively. Now we evaluate $Z = 2 0 0 x + 5 0 0 y$ at these points. \n\nHence, minimum value of $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { Z } }$ is 2300 attained at the point (4, 3) \n\nExample 3 Solve the following problem graphically: \n\nMinimise and Maximise $Z = 3 x + 9 y$ \n\nsubject to the constraints: \n\nSolution First of all, letus graph the feasible region of the system of linear inequalities (2) to (5). The feasible region ABCD is shown in the Fig 12.4. Note that the region is bounded. The coordinates of the corner points A,B, C and D are (O,1O),(5,5),(15,15) and (0,20) respectively. \n\nWe now find the minimum and maximum value of Z.From the table, we find that the minimum value of Z is 6O at the point B (5,5) of the feasible region. \n\nThe maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two corner points C (15,15) and D (0,20) and it is 180 in each case. \n\nRemark Observe that in the above example, the problem has multiple optimal solutions at the corner points C and D,i.e. the both points produce same maximum value 180. In such cases, you can see that every point on the line segment CD joining the two corner points C and D also give the same maximum value. Same is also true in the case if the two points produce same minimum value. \n\nExample 4 Determine graphically the minimum value of the objective function \n\nsubject to the constraints: \n\nSolution First of all,let us graph the feasible region of the system of inequalities (2) to (5). The feasible region (shaded) is shown in the Fig 12.5. Observe that the feasible region is unbounded. \n\nWe now evaluate Z at the corner points. \n\nFrom this table, we find that - 3OO is the smallest value of Z at the corner point (6, 0). Can we say that minimum value of $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { Z } }$ is - 30O? Note that if the region would have been bounded, this smallest value of $\\textsf { Z }$ is the minimum value of Z (Theorem 2). But here we see that the feasible region is unbounded. Therefore, $- 3 0 0$ may or may not be the minimum value of Z. To decide this issue, we graph the inequality \n\n$- 5 0 x + 2 0 y < - 3 0 0$ (see Step 3(ii) of corner Point Method.) \n\ni.e., \n\nand check whether the resulting open half plane has points in common with feasible region or not. If it has common points, then $- 3 0 0$ will not be the minimum value of $Z$ Otherwise, $- 3 0 0$ will be the minimum value of $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { Z } }$ . \n\nAs shown in the Fig 12.5, it has common points. Therefore, $Z = - 5 0 \\ x + 2 0 \\ y$ has no minimum value subject to the given constraints. \n\nIn the above example, can you say whether $z = - 5 0 x + 2 0 y$ has the maximum value 10O at (0.5)? For this, check whether the graph of $- 5 0 x + 2 0 y > 1 0 0$ has points in common with the feasible region. (Why?) \n\nExample 5 Minimise $Z = 3 x + 2 y$ \n\nsubject to the constraints: \n\nSolution Let us graph the inequalities (1) to (3) (Fig 12.6). Is there any feasible region? Why is so? 1 \n\nFrom Fig 12.6,you can see that there is no point satisfying all the constraints simultaneously. Thus, the problem is having no feasible region and hence no feasible solution. \n\nRemarks From the examples which we have discussed so far, we notice some general features of linear programming problems: \n\n(1)IIc icasIuic icgiUll iS aIways a convex region.   \n(ii) The maximum (or minimum) Fig 12.6 solution of the objective function occurs at the vertex (corner) of the feasible region.

Variables are sometimes called decision variables and are non-negative. \n\nHistorical Note \n\nIn the World War II, when the war operations had to be planned to economise expenditure, maximise damage to the enemy, linear programming problems came to the forefront. \n\nThe first problem in linear programming was formulated in 1941 by the Russian mathematician,L. Kantorovich and the American economist, F.L. Hitchcock, both of whom worked at it independently of each other. This was the well known transportation problem. In 1945, an English economist, G.Stigler, described yet another linear programming problem - that of determining an optimal diet. \n\nIn 1947, the American economist, G. B. Dantzig suggested an efficient method known as the simplex method which is an iterative procedure to solve any linear programming problem in a finite number of steps. \n\nL. Katorovich and American mathematical economist, T. C. Koopmans were awarded the nobel prize in the year 1975 in economics for their pioneering work in linear programming. With the advent of computers and the necessary softwares, it has become possible to apply linear programming model to increasingly complex problems in many areas.",

PEIRCE \n\n13.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier Classes,we have studied the probability as a measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment. We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the experiment. We have also established equivalence between the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability in case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated with discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the addition rule of probability.In this chapter, we shall discuss the important concept of conditional probability of an event given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of probability and independence of events. We shall also learn an important concept of random variable and its probability distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability distribution.In the last section of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution called Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shalltake up the experiments having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise. \n\n13.2 Conditional Probability \n\nUptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of events. If we have two events from the same sample space,does the information about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes are equally likely to occur. \n\nConsider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the experiment is \n\nSince thecoins are fair, we can assign the probability $\\frac 1 8$ to each sample point. Let E be the event at least two heads appear' and $\\mathrm { F }$ be the event ‘first coin shows tail'. Then \n\nand \n\nTherefore \n\nand \n\nAlso \n\nwith \n\nNow, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail,i.e.F occurs, then what is the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the set S to its subset F for the event E.In other words, the additional information really amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F. \n\nNow, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH. \n\nThus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space $= { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } }$ \n\nor \n\nProbability of E given that the event F has occurred $= { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } }$ \n\nThis probability of the event E is called the conditional probability of $E$ given that $F$ has already occurred,and is denoted by P (ElF). \n\nThus \n\nNote that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of E and F, i.e. the sample points of $\\operatorname { E } \\cap \\operatorname { F }$ \n\nThus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as \n\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events of the sample space, we see that P(ElF) can also be written as \n\nNote that (1) is valid only when $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { F } ) \\neq 0$ i.e., $\\mathrm { F } \\neq \\boldsymbol \\Phi$ (Why?) \n\nThus, we can define the conditional probability as follows : \n\nDefinition 1 If E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred, i.e. P (EIF) is given by \n\n13.2.1 Properties of conditional probability \n\nLet E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have \n\nProperty 1 $\\mathrm { P ( S | F ) } = \\mathrm { P ( F | F ) } = 1$ \n\nWe know that \n\nAlso \n\nThus \n\nProperty 2 If A and B are any two events of $a$ sample space S and $\\mathrm { F }$ is an event of S such that $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { F } ) \\neq 0 .$ ，then \n\nIn particular, if A and B are disjoint events, then \n\nWe have \n\n(by distributive law of union of sets over intersection) \n\nWhen A and B are disjoint events, then \n\n→ \n\nProperty 3 P(E'F) = 1 - P(EIF) \n\nFrom Property 1, we know that $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { S } | \\mathrm { F } ) = 1$ \n\nThus, \n\nLet us now take up some examples. \n\nExample 1 If $\\mathrm { P ( A ) } = \\frac { 7 } { 1 3 }$ 1,P(B)= and $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { A } \\cap \\mathrm { B } ) = { \\frac { 4 } { 1 3 } }$ , evaluate P(AIB). \n\n一 $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { P ( A | B ) } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { P ( A \\cap B ) } } { \\mathrm { P ( B ) } } } = { \\frac { \\displaystyle { \\frac { 4 } { 1 3 } } } { \\displaystyle { \\frac { 9 } { 1 3 } } } } = { \\frac { 4 } { 9 } }$ Solution We have \n\nExample 2 A family has two children.What is the probability that both the children are boys given that at least one of them is a boy ? \n\nSolution Let $^ b$ stand for boy and $g$ for girl. The sample space of the experiment is \n\nLet E and F denote the following events : \n\nE :‘both the children are boys' F :‘at least one of the child is a boy \n\nThen \n\nNow \n\nThus \n\nTherefore \n\nExample 3 Ten cards numbered 1 to 10 are placed in a box, mixed up thoroughly and then one card is drawn randomly. If it is known that the number on the drawn card is more than 3,what is the probability that it is an even number? \n\nSolution Let A be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is even’and B be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is greater than $_ { 3 } ,$ . We have to find P(AIB). \n\nNow, the sample space of the experiment is $\\mathrm { S } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 1 0 \\}$ \n\nThen \n\nand \n\nAlso \n\nThen \n\nExample 4 In a school, there are 100O students,out of which 430 are girls. It is known that out of 430, $10 \\%$ of the girls study in class XII. What is the probability that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII given that the chosen student is a girl? \n\nSolution Let E denote the event that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XI and F be the event that the randomly chosen student is a girl. We have to find P(ElF). \n\nNow \n\nThen \n\nExample 5 A die is thrown three times. Events A and $\\mathbf { B }$ are defined as below: \n\n$\\mathrm { A } : 4$ on the third throw   \n$\\mathbf { B } : 6$ on the first and 5 on the second throw   \nFind the probability of A given that B has already occurred. \n\nSolution The sample space has 216 outcomes. \n\nNow \n\nand \n\n$\\mathbf { B } = \\{ ( 6 , 5 , 1 )$ , (6,5,2), (6,5,3), (6,5,4), (6,5,5), (6,5,6)) \n\nNow \n\nThen \n\nExample 6 A die is thrown twice and the sum of the numbers appearing is observed to be 6. What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once? + \n\nSolution Let E be the event that ‘number 4 appears at least once’ and F be the event that ‘the sum of the numbers appearing is $\\mathbf { \\omega } ^ { 6 }$ \n\nThen, E = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)) and $\\mathrm { F } = \\{ ( 1 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) \\}$ \n\nWe have $\\mathrm { P ( E ) } = { \\frac { 1 1 } { 3 6 } } { \\mathrm { a n d ~ } } \\mathrm { P ( F ) } = { \\frac { 5 } { 3 6 } }$ \n\nAlso \n\nTherefore \n\nHence, the required probability \n\nFor the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elementary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of the probability of an event was used. However, the same definition can also be used in the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally likely, the probabilities $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { F } )$ and P(F) being calculated accordingly. Let us take up the following example. \n\nExample 7 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it again but if it shows tail, then throw a die.Find the conditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows a number greater than $_ 4 \\cdot$ given that ‘there is at least one tail'. \n\nSolution The outcomes of the experiment can be represented in following diagrammatic manner called the ‘tree diagram'. \n\nThe sample space of the experiment may be described as \n\n${ \\bf S } = \\{ ( { \\bf H } , { \\bf H } )$ , (H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6) \n\nwhere (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into head and $( \\mathrm { T } , i )$ denote the first toss result into a tail and the number $i$ appeared on the die for $i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .$ \n\nThus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary events \n\n$( \\mathrm { H } , \\mathrm { H } ) , ( \\mathrm { H } , \\mathrm { T } ) , ( \\mathrm { T } , 1 ) , ( \\mathrm { T } , 2 ) , ( \\mathrm { T } , 3 ) ( \\mathrm { T } , 4 ) , ( \\mathrm { T } , 5 ) , ( \\mathrm { T } , 6 )$ are $\\frac { 1 } { 4 } , \\frac { 1 } { 4 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } , \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 }$ respectively which is clear from the Fig 13.2. \n\nLet F be the event that ‘there is at least one tail' and E be the event ‘the die shows a number greater than $_ 4 \\cdot$ . Then \n\nNow \n\nHence \n\nEXERCISE 13.1 \n\n1.

Clearly, the set $\\mathrm { ~ E ~ } \\cap \\mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ denotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, $\\operatorname { E } \\cap \\operatorname { F }$ denotes the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event $\\operatorname { E } \\cap \\operatorname { F }$ is also written as EF. \n\nVery often we need to find the probability of the event EF. For example, in the experiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding the probability of the event ‘a king and a queen'.The probability of event EF is obtained by using the conditional probability as obtained below : \n\nWe know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is denoted by P(ElF) and is given by \n\nFrom this result, we can write \n\nAlso, we know that \n\nor \n\nThus, \n\nCombining (1) and (2), we find that \n\nThe above result is known as the multiplication rule of probability. \n\nLet us now take up an example. \n\nExample 8 An urn contains 1O black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn balls are black? \n\nSolution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn are black. We have to find $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { F } )$ or P (EF). \n\nNow \n\nAlso given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn.Therefore,the probability that the second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred. \n\ni.e. \n\nBy multiplication rule of probability, we have \n\nMultiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are three events of sample space,we have \n\nSimilarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or more events. \n\nThe following exampleillustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability for three events. \n\nExample 9 Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of 52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the third card drawn is an ace? \n\nSolution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA) \n\nNow \n\nAlso,P(KlK) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has already been drawn. Now there are three kings in $( 5 2 - 1 ) = 5 1$ cards. \n\nTherefore \n\nLastly,P(AlKK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 5O cards. \n\nTherefore \n\nBy multiplication law of probability, we have \n\n13.4 Independent Events \n\nConsider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely.If E and $\\mathrm { F }$ denote the events 'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then \n\nAlso E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that \n\nHence \n\nSince $\\mathrm { P ( E ) } = { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } \\mathrm { = P }$ (EIF),we can say that the occurrence of event $\\mathrm { F }$ has not affected the probability of occurrence of the event E. \n\nWe also have \n\nAgain, $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { F } ) = { \\frac { 1 } { 1 3 } } = \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { F } | \\mathrm { E } )$ shows that occurrence of event E has not affected the probability of occurrence of the event F. \n\nThus,E and $\\mathrm { F }$ are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of them is not affected by occurrence of the other. \n\nSuch events are called independent events. \n\nDefinition 2 Two events E and $\\mathrm { F }$ are said to be independent, if \n\nand $\\begin{array} { l } { { \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { F } | \\mathrm { E } \\right) = \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { F } \\right) \\mathrm { p r o v i d e d } \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { E } \\right) \\mathrm { ~ } \\not = 0 } } \\\\ { { \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { E } | \\mathrm { F } \\right) = \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { E } \\right) \\mathrm { p r o v i d e d } \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { F } \\right) \\mathrm { ~ } \\not = 0 } } \\end{array}$ \n\nThus,in this definition we need to have $\\mathrm { P \\left( E \\right) } \\neq 0$ and $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { F } ) \\neq 0$ \n\nNow, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have \n\n$\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { F } ) = \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } ) \\mathrm { ~ . ~ } \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { F } | \\mathrm { E } \\right)$ ... (1) \n\nIf E and $\\mathrm { F }$ are independent, then （1) becomes \n\n$\\mathrm { P ( E \\cap F ) } = \\mathrm { P ( E ) } \\ . \\ \\mathrm { P ( F ) }$ \n\nThus,using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows: \n\nDefinition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment, then E and F are said to be independent if O \n\nRemarks (i) Two events E and $\\mathrm { F }$ are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { F } ) \\neq \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } ) \\ . \\ \\mathrm { P } \\left( \\mathrm { F } \\right)$   \n(ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually exclusive events.Term ‘independent’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events' whereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space). Moreover, mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but independent events,may have common outcome. Clearly, ‘independent’ and ‘mutually exclusive' do not have the same meaning. In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be mutually exclusive, and conversely,i.e. two mutually exclusive events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent.   \n(ii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F, where E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment, the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the two experiments are performed is the product of $\\mathrm { P ( E ) }$ and P(F) calculated separately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., $\\mathbf { \\partial } ^ { \\prime } \\left( \\operatorname { E } \\cap \\operatorname { F } \\right) = \\mathbf { P }$ (E) .P(F)   \n(iv) Three events A,B and C are said to be mutually independent, if $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { A } \\cap \\mathrm { B } ) = \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { A } ) \\ \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { B } )$ $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { A } \\cap \\mathrm { C } ) = \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { A } ) \\ \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { C } )$ $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathbf { B } \\cap \\mathbf { C } ) = \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathbf { B } ) \\ \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathbf { C } )$ and $\\mathrm { P ( A \\cap B \\cap C ) } = \\mathrm { P ( A ) } \\ \\mathrm { P ( B ) } \\ \\mathrm { P ( C ) }$ \n\nIf at least one of the above is not true for three given events,we say that the events are not independent. \n\nExample 10 A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of $_ 3 \\ '$ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and $\\mathrm { F }$ are independent ? \n\nSolution We know that the sample space is $\\mathrm { S } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\}$ \n\nExample 11 An unbiased die is thrown twice. Let the event A be ‘odd number on the first throw'and B the event odd number on the second throw'.Check the independence of the events A and B. \n\nSolution If allthe 36 elementary events of the experiment are considered to be equally likely, we have \n\nAlso \n\n$\\operatorname { P } ( \\mathbf { A } \\cap \\mathbf { B } ) = \\operatorname { P }$ (odd number on both throws) \n\nNow \n\nClearly \n\nThus, \n\nA and B are independent events \n\nExample 12 Three coins are tossed simultaneously.

Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and Bag I contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } )$ or probability of drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if we are given the bag from which the ballis drawn.But, can we find the probability that the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an event occurred after it is known.Famous mathematician,John Bayes' solved the problem of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed by him is known as‘Bayes theorem' which was published posthumously in 1763. Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem,let us first take up a definition and some preliminary results. \n\n13.5.1 Partition of a sample space \n\nA set of events $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } , . . . , \\operatorname { E } _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if \n\n(b) $\\operatorname { E } _ { _ 1 } \\cup \\operatorname { E } _ { _ 2 } \\cup \\ldots \\cup \\operatorname { E } _ { _ n } = \\operatorname { S }$ and (c） $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { } } ) { > } 0$ for all $i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n$ \n\nIn other words, the events $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } , . . . , \\operatorname { E } _ { n }$ represent a partition of the sample space S if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities. \n\nAs an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement $\\mathrm { E ^ { \\prime } }$ form a partition of the sample space S since they satisfy $\\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\prime } = \\boldsymbol \\Phi$ and $\\mathrm { E } \\cup \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\prime } = \\mathrm { S }$ \n\nFrom the Venn diagram in $\\mathrm { F i g } 1 3 . 3$ , one can easily observe that if E and $\\mathrm { F }$ are any two events associated with a sample space S, then the set $\\{ \\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { F } , \\mathrm { E } \\cap \\mathrm { F } , \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\prime } \\cap \\mathrm { F } , \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\prime } \\cap \\mathrm { F } ^ { \\prime } \\}$ is a partition of the sample space S. It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample space is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space. \n\nWe shall now prove a theorem known as Theorem of total probability. \n\n13.5.2 Theorem of total probability \n\nLet $\\{ \\mathrm { E } _ { _ 1 } , \\mathrm { E } _ { _ 2 } , . . . , \\mathrm { E } _ { _ n } \\}$ be a partition of the sample space S, and suppose that each of the events $\\operatorname { E } _ { _ 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { _ 2 } , . . . , \\operatorname { E } _ { _ n }$ has nonzero probability of occurrence.Let Abe any event associated with S, then ? \n\nProof Given that $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } , . . . , \\operatorname { E } _ { n }$ is a partition of the sample space S (Fig 13.4). Therefore, \n\nand \n\nNow, we know that for any event A, \n\nAlso $\\mathbf { A } \\cap \\mathbf { E } _ { i }$ and $\\mathbf { A } \\cap \\mathbf { E } _ { j }$ are respectively the subsets of $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { \\it _ i } }$ and $\\mathrm { E } _ { j }$ . We know that $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle i }$ and $\\mathrm { E } _ { j }$ are disjoint, for $i \\neq j$ , therefore,A $\\cap \\operatorname { E } _ { i }$ and A $\\cap \\mathrm { E } _ { j }$ are also disjoint for all $i \\neq j , i , j = 1 , 2 , . . . , n .$ \n\nThus, \n\nNow, by multiplication rule of probability, we have \n\nTherefore, \n\nor \n\nExample 15 A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65 that there will be strike, O.8O that the construction job will be completed on time if there is no strike,and O.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a strike.Determine the probability that the construction job willbe completed on time. \n\nSolution Let Abe the event that the construction job willbe completed on time, and B be theventhtilliWe). > \n\nSince events B and $\\mathbf { B } ^ { \\prime }$ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem on total probability, we have \n\nThus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488. \n\nWe shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem. \n\nBayes’ Theorem If $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { , } } \\ldots , \\operatorname { E } _ { n }$ are $n$ non empty events which constitute a partition of sample space S, i.e. $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { , } } \\ldots , \\operatorname { E } _ { n }$ are pairwise disjoint and $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } \\cup \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } \\cup \\ldots \\cup \\operatorname { E } _ { n } = \\operatorname { S }$ and A is any event of nonzero probability, then \n\nProof By formula of conditional probability, we know that \n\nRemark The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied. \n\nThe events $\\operatorname { E } _ { 1 } , \\operatorname { E } _ { 2 } , . . . , \\operatorname { E } _ { n }$ are called hypotheses. \n\nThe probability $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { \\ell } } )$ is called the priori probability of the hypothesis $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { \\it { i } } }$ \n\nThe conditional probability $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } _ { i } \\left| \\mathrm { A } \\right. )$ is called a posteriori probability of the hypothesis $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle i }$ \n\nBayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of \"causes\". Since the $\\mathrm { E } _ { i } ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { s }$ are a partition of the sample space S,one and only one of the events $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { \\it _ i } }$ occurs (i.e. one of the events $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\scriptscriptstyle i }$ must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula gives us the probability of a particular $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { } _ { i } }$ (i.e.a \"Cause\"), given that the event A has occurred. \n\nThe Bayes' theorem has its applications in variety of situations,few of which are illustrated in following examples. \n\nExample 16 Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to be red. Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II. \n\nSolution Let $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ be the event of choosing the bag I, $\\mathrm { E } _ { 2 }$ the event of choosing the bag II and A be the event of drawing a red ball. \n\nThen \n\nAlso \n\nNow, the probability of drawing a ball from Bag II, being given that it is red, is $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } _ { 2 } | \\mathrm { A } )$ \n\nBy using Bayes' theorem, we have \n\nExample 17 Given three identical boxes I, II and III, each containing two coins. In box I, both coins are gold coins,in box I,both are silver coins and in the box II, there is one gold and one silver coin. A person chooses a box at random and takes out a coin. If the coin is of gold, what is the probability that the other coin in the box is also of gold? \n\nSolution Let $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } , \\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { 2 } }$ and $\\mathrm { E } _ { 3 }$ be the events that boxes I, II and IIIare chosen,respectively. \n\nThen \n\nAlso,let A be the event that ‘the coin drawn is of gold' \n\nThen \n\nNow, the probability that the other coin in the box is of gold \n\nBy Bayes' theorem, we know that \n\nExample 18 Suppose that the reliability of a HIV test is specified as follows: \n\nOf people having HIV, $90 \\%$ of the test detect the disease but $10 \\%$ go undetected. Of people free of HIV, $9 9 \\%$ of the test are judged HIV-ive but $1 \\%$ are diagnosed as showing HIV+ive.From a large population of which only $0 . 1 \\%$ have HIV,one person is selected at random, given the HIV test, and the pathologist reports him/her as $\\mathrm { H I V } +$ ive. What is the probability that the person actually has HIV? \n\nSolution Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive.We need to find P(ElA). \n\nAlso $\\mathrm { E ^ { \\prime } }$ denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV. \n\nClearly, $\\{ \\mathrm { E } , \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\prime } \\}$ is a partition of the sample space of all people in the population. We are given that \n\n$\\mathrm { P ( A | E ) } = \\mathrm { P } ($ Person tested as HIV+ive given that he/she is actually having HIV) \n\nand \n\n$\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { A } | \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\prime } ) = \\mathrm { P } ($ Person tested as HIV $^ +$ ive given that he/she is actually not having HIV) \n\nNow, by Bayes' theorem \n\nThus, the probability that a person selected at random is actually having HIV given that he/she is tested $\\mathrm { H I V } +$ ive is 0.083. \n\nExample 19 In a factory which manufactures bolts, machines A, B and C manufacture respectively $2 5 \\%$ ， $35 \\%$ and $40 \\%$ of the bolts. Of their outputs,5,4 and 2 percent are respectively defective bolts. A bolt is drawn at random from the product and is found to be defective. What is the probability that it is manufactured by the machine B? \n\nSolution Let events $\\mathbf { B } _ { 1 }$ ， $\\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ， $\\mathbf { B } _ { 3 }$ be the following : \n\n$\\mathbf { B } _ { 1 }$ : the bolt is manufactured by machine A $\\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ : the bolt is manufactured by machine B $\\mathbf { B } _ { 3 }$ : the bolt is manufactured by machine C \n\nClearly, $\\mathbf { B } _ { 1 }$ ， $\\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ， $\\mathbf { B } _ { 3 }$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and hence, the. represent a partition of the sample space. \n\nLet the event E be ‘the bolt is defective'. \n\nThe event E occurs with $\\mathbf { B } _ { 1 }$ or with $\\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ or with $\\mathbf { B } _ { 3 }$ . Given that, \n\nAgain $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } | \\mathbf { B } _ { 1 } ) = \\mathrm { P } \\mathrm { 1 }$ obability that the bolt drawn is defective given that it is manufactured by machine $\\mathrm { A } = 5 \\% = 0 . 0 5$ \n\nSimilarly， $\\mathrm { P ( E | B _ { 2 } ) } = 0 . 0 4 , \\mathrm { P ( E | B _ { 3 } ) } = 0 . 0 2 .$ \n\nHence, by Bayes' Theorem, we have \n\nExample 2O A doctor is to visit a patient. From the past experience, it is known that the probabilities that he will come by train, bus, scooter or by other means of transport are respectively ${ \\frac { 3 } { 1 0 } } , { \\frac { 1 } { 5 } } , { \\frac { 1 } { 1 0 } } \\mathrm { a n d } { \\frac { 2 } { 5 } }$ . The probabilities that he will be late are ${ \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } , { \\frac { 1 } { 3 } }$ and ${ \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } } .$ if he comes by train, bus and scooter respectively, but if he comes by other means of transport, then he will not be late. When he arrives, he is late. What is the probability that he comes by train? \n\nSolution Let E be the event that the doctor visits the patient late and let $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ be the events that the doctor comes by train, bus, scooter, and other means of transport respectively. \n\nThen \n\nPE）ri \n\nSimilarly, $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } | \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } ) = \\frac { 1 } { 3 }$ ， $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } | \\bar { \\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } } ) = \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { P ( E | T _ { 4 } ) } = 0$ ,since he is not late if he comes by other means of transport. \n\nTherefore, by Bayes' Theorem, we have \n\n$\\mathrm { P ( T _ { 1 } | E ) = }$ Probability that the doctor arriving late comes by train \n\nHence, the required probability is $\\frac 1 2$ \n\nExample 21 A man is known to speak truth 3 out of 4 times. He throws a die and reports that it is a six.Find the probability that it is actually a six. \n\nSolution Let E be the event that the man reports that six occurs in the throwing of the die and let $\\mathrm { \\Delta S } _ { 1 }$ be the event that six occurs and $\\mathbf { S } _ { 2 }$ be the event that six does not occur. \n\nThen \n\n$\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { S } _ { 2 } ) = \\mathrm { P r o b a b i l i t y ~ t h a t } s i x \\mathrm { d o e s ~ n o t ~ o c c u r } = \\frac { 3 } { 6 }$ $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } | \\mathrm { \\bf S } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } ) =$ Probability that the man reports that six occurs when six has actually occurred on the die $=$ Probability that the man speaks the truth : ned 4 $\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { E } | \\mathrm { \\bf S } _ { 2 } ) =$ Probability that the man reports that six occurs when six has not actually occurred on the die $= 1 - { \\frac { 3 } { 4 } } = { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } }$ $=$ Probability that the man does not speak the truth Thus, by Bayes' theorem, we get \n\n$\\mathrm { P } ( \\mathbf { S } _ { 1 } | \\mathrm { E } ) =$ Probability that the report of the man that six has occurred is actually a six P(S,)P(E IS,) P(S,)P(EIS,)+P(S2)P(EIS2) $= \\frac { \\frac { 1 } { 6 } \\times \\frac { 3 } { 4 } } { \\frac { 1 } { 6 } \\times \\frac { 3 } { 4 } + \\frac { 5 } { 6 } \\times \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } = \\frac { 1 } { 8 } \\times \\frac { 2 4 } { 8 } = \\frac { 3 } { 8 }$ \n\nHenee,te rquire grobabiyis ${ \\frac { 3 } { 8 } } \\cdot$ \n\nRemark A random variable is a real valued function whose domain is the sample space of a random experiment. \n\nFor example,let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times in succession. \n\nThe sample space of the experiment is $\\mathrm { S } = \\{ \\mathrm { H H } , \\mathrm { H T } , \\mathrm { T H } , \\mathrm { T T } \\}$ \n\nIf $\\mathrm { X }$ denotes the number of heads obtained, then $\\mathrm { X }$ is a random variable and for each outcome,its value is as given below : \n\nMore than one random variables can be defined on the same sample space. For example,let Y denote the number of heads minus the number of tails for each outcome of the above sample space S. \n\nThus, $\\mathrm { X }$ and $\\mathrm { Y }$ are two diferent random variables defined on the same sample space S. \n\nEXERCISE 13.3 \n\n1.

A treatise on gambling named liber de Ludo Alcae, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published posthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases for each event when two dice are thrown. \n\nGalileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation of chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are thrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9, because the number of cases favourable to 1O are more than the number of cases for the appearance of number 9. \n\nApart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the true origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two great men of the seventeenth century, Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain some seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the observation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654, Pascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability. Pascal solved the problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations. \n\nGreat Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the content of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first book on probability,\"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae\" containing solution of many interesting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances. \n\nThe next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli(1654-1705), in the form of a great book, \"Ars Conjectendi\" published posthumously in 1713 by his nephew, Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most important probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next remarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book, ‘Foundations of probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is considered a ‘classic!'.",

The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). \n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. \n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children's life at school a happy experience,rather than a source of stress or boredom.Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,discussion in smal groups,and activities requiring hands-on experience. \n\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book.We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and Mathematics,Professor J.V.Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P.K.Jain for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible.We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement. \n\nNew Delhi 20 November 2006 \n\nDirector National Council of Educational Research and Training \n\nRationalisation of Content in the Textbooks \n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2O20,also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset.In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. n \n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: \n\nOverlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject . Difficulty level . Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning 1 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context \n\nThis present edition,is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. \n\nPreface \n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had constituted 21 Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education, to review the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 2000 (NCFSE - 2Ooo) in face of new emerging challenges and transformations occurring in the fields of content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International spectrum of school education. These Focus Groups made general and specific comments in their respective areas. Consequently, based on these reports of Focus Groups,National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed. \n\nNCERT designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development Teams for Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in Mathematics under the new guidelines and new syllabi. The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was brought in 2005. \n\nThe first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team consisting of NCERT faculty, experts and practicing teachers. The draft was refined by the development team in different meetings. This draft of the book was exposed to a group of practicing teachers teaching Mathematics at higher secondary stage in different parts of the country, in a review workshop organised by the NCERT at Delhi. The teachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated in the draft textbook. The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted out of the development team.Finally, the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics and the Monitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry, Government of India have approved the draft of the textbook. \n\nIn the fitness of things,let us cite some of the essential features dominating the textbook. These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters.The existing textbook contains thirteen main chapters and two appendices.Each chapter contains the followings : \n\n■Introduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier studied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the chapter.   \nOrganisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/ subconcepts. Motivating and introducing the concepts/subconcepts. Illustrations have been provided wherever possible.   \n■Proofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity of approaches wherever possible have been inducted.   \nGeometric viewing / visualisation of concepts have been emphasized whenever needed. Applications of mathematical concepts have also been integrated with allied subjects like Science and Social Sciences.   \nAdequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section. For refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skillof problem solving and applicabilities,miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been provided involving two or more subconcepts at a time at the end of the chapter. The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected conducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005.   \nFor more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been provided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter, relevant quotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed significantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided.   \nLastly, for direct recapitulation of main concepts, formulas and results, brief summary of the chapter has also been provided. \n\nI am thankful to Professor Krishan Kumar, Director, NCERT who constituted the team and invited me to join this national endeavour for the improvement of Mathematics education.He has provided us with an enlightened perspective and a very conducive environment. This made the task of preparing the book much more enjoyable and rewarding.I express my gratitude to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics, for his specific suggestions and advice towards the improvement of the book from time to time.I,also, thank Professor G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT for his help from time to time. \n\nIexpress my sincere thanks to Professor Hukum Singh, Chief Coordinator and Head, DESM, Dr. V. P. Singh, Coordinator and Professor, S. K. Singh Gautam who have been helping for the success of this project academically as wellas administratively. Also,I would like to place on records my appreciation and thanks to all the members of the team and the teachers who have been associated with this noble cause in one or the other form. \n\nTextbook Development Committee \n\nCHAIRPERSON,ADVISORY GROUP IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS   \nJ.V.
